Summary

What is already known about this topic?

SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs in congregate settings, including colleges and universities.

What is added by this report?

Investigation of 17 COVID-19 cases among a university’s men’s and women’s soccer team identified numerous social gatherings as possible transmission events. Minimal mask use and social distancing resulted in rapid spread among students who live, practice, and socialize together.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Colleges and universities are at risk for COVID-19 outbreaks because of shared housing and social gatherings where recommended prevention guidance is not followed. Schools should consider conducting periodic repeat testing of asymptomatic students to identify outbreaks early and implementing policies and improving messaging to promote mask use and social distancing.",science,2,1603921249,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

An outbreak of 59 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) originated with 13 cases linked by a 7 h, 17% occupancy flight into Ireland, summer 2020. The flight-associated attack rate was 9.8–17.8%. Spread to 46 non-flight cases occurred country-wide. Asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic transmission in-flight from a point source is implicated by 99% homology across the virus genome in five cases travelling from three different continents. Restriction of movement on arrival and robust contact tracing can limit propagation post-flight.",science,1,1603888262,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has caused over a million human deaths and massive global disruption. The viral infection may also represent a threat to our closest living relatives, nonhuman primates. The contact surface of the host cell receptor, ACE2, displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these critical residues modulate infection susceptibility. Infection studies have shown that some primate species develop COVID-19-like symptoms; however, the susceptibility of most primates is unknown. Here, we show that all apes and African and Asian monkeys (catarrhines), exhibit the same set of twelve key amino acid residues as human ACE2. Monkeys in the Americas, and some tarsiers, lemurs and lorisoids, differ at critical contact residues, and protein modeling predicts that these differences should greatly reduce SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity. Other lemurs are predicted to be closer to catarrhines in their susceptibility. Our study suggests that apes and African and Asian monkeys, and some lemurs, are likely to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Urgent actions have been undertaken to limit the exposure of great apes to humans, and similar efforts may be necessary for many other primate species.",science,1,1603887849,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

We studied sources of variation between countries in per-capita mortality from COVID-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus). Potential predictors of per-capita coronavirus-related mortality in 200 countries by May 9, 2020 were examined, including age, gender, obesity prevalence, temperature, urbanization, smoking, duration of the outbreak, lockdowns, viral testing, contact-tracing policies, and public mask-wearing norms and policies. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed. In univariate analysis, the prevalence of smoking, per-capita gross domestic product, urbanization, and colder average country temperature was positively associated with coronavirus-related mortality. In a multivariable analysis of 196 countries, the duration of the outbreak in the country, and the proportion of the population aged 60 years or older were positively associated with per-capita mortality, whereas duration of mask-wearing by the public was negatively associated with mortality (all P &lt; 0.001). Obesity and less stringent international travel restrictions were independently associated with mortality in a model which controlled for testing policy. Viral testing policies and levels were not associated with mortality. Internal lockdown was associated with a nonsignificant 2.4% reduction in mortality each week (P = 0.83). The association of contact-tracing policy with mortality was not statistically significant (P = 0.06). In countries with cultural norms or government policies supporting public mask-wearing, per-capita coronavirus mortality increased on average by just 16.2% each week, as compared with 61.9% each week in remaining countries. Societal norms and government policies supporting the wearing of masks by the public, as well as international travel controls, are independently associated with lower per-capita mortality from COVID-19.",science,1,1603887489,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Discussion

Our results suggest that dozens of nonhuman primate species, including all of our closest relatives, are likely to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and vulnerable to its effects. Major actions may be needed to limit the exposure of many wild primate populations to humans. This is likely to require coordinated input from all stakeholders, including local communities, international and national governmental agencies, non-governmental conservation and development organizations, and academics and researchers. While the focus of many at this time is rightly on mitigating the humanitarian devastation of COVID-19, we also have a duty to ensure that our closest living relatives do not suffer from devastating infections and further population declines in response to yet another human-induced catastrophe.",science,6,1603842754,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Longitudinal observation and decline of neutralizing antibody responses in the three months following SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. 

Nature Microbiology (2020). 

Published: 26 October 2020

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-00813-8

Abstract

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most infected individuals 10–15 d after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. However, due to the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population, it is not known how long antibody responses will be maintained or whether they will provide protection from reinfection. Using sequential serum samples collected up to 94 d post onset of symptoms (POS) from 65 individuals with real-time quantitative PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, we show seroconversion (immunoglobulin (Ig)M, IgA, IgG) in &gt;95% of cases and neutralizing antibody responses when sampled beyond 8 d POS. We show that the kinetics of the neutralizing antibody response is typical of an acute viral infection, with declining neutralizing antibody titres observed after an initial peak, and that the magnitude of this peak is dependent on disease severity. Although some individuals with high peak infective dose (ID50 &gt; 10,000) maintained neutralizing antibody titres &gt;1,000 at &gt;60 d POS, some with lower peak ID50 had neutralizing antibody titres approaching baseline within the follow-up period. A similar decline in neutralizing antibody titres was observed in a cohort of 31 seropositive healthcare workers. The present study has important implications when considering widespread serological testing and antibody protection against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2, and may suggest that vaccine boosters are required to provide long-lasting protection.",science,1,1603794192,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Frontiers in Psychiatry, 23 September 2020 

DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.582352

Abstract 

Background: As evidenced by several studies, mental distress increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this period, citizens were asked to exercise a high degree of self-control with regard to personal and social health behavior. At the same time, we witnessed an increase of prosocial acts and shared creative expressions, which are known to serve as sources of meaning. Meaning in life and self-control are acknowledged psychological resources. Especially in times of crisis, meaning in life has been shown to be a crucial factor for resilience and coping. However, threatening and stressful situations can also jeopardize existential security and trigger crises of meaning. The present study aimed to document levels of acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress in Germany and Austria during the lockdown and in the weeks thereafter. In order to identify potential risk factors related to demographics and living conditions, their associations with COVID-19 stress were analyzed exploratively. The primary objective of the study, however, was to investigate the buffering effect of two psychological resources—meaningfulness and self-control—with regard to the relation between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress. Finally, a potential aggravation of mental distress due to the occurrence of crises of meaning was examined.

Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online during lockdown (survey group 1) and the subsequent weeks characterized by eased restrictions (survey group 2). A total of N = 1,538 German-speaking participants completed a questionnaire battery including a novel measure of acute COVID-19 stress, meaningfulness and crisis of meaning (SoMe), self-control (SCS-KD), and a screening of general mental distress, measured by core symptoms of depression and anxiety (PHQ-4). In a first step, associations between living conditions, demographics, and COVID-19 stress were explored. Second, a moderation and a mediation model were tested. Meaningfulness, a measure of presence of meaning in life, as well as self-control were proposed to serve as buffers in a time of crisis, thus moderating the relation between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress (double moderation). Crisis of meaning, operationalizing an experienced lack of meaning in life, was proposed to mediate the relationship between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress, with an assumed moderation of the association between COVID-19 stress and crisis of meaning by survey group (lockdown versus eased restrictions after lockdown), and a hypothesized moderation of the link between crisis of meaning and general mental distress by self-control (dual moderated mediation).

Results: COVID-19 stress was slightly right-skewed. Scores were higher during lockdown than in the weeks thereafter. The rate of clinically significant general mental distress was high, exceeding prevalence rates from both the general population and clinical samples of the time before the pandemic. In the weeks following the lockdown (group 2), general mental distress and crisis of meaning were significantly higher than during lockdown (group 1), whereas meaningfulness and self-control were significantly lower. Demographically, age had the strongest association with COVID-19 stress, with older participants perceiving less acute stress (r = −.21). People who were partnered or married suffered less from COVID-19 stress (η2 = .01). Living alone (η2 = .006), living in a room versus a flat or house (η2 = .008), and being unemployed due to the pandemic (η2 = .008) were related to higher experience of COVID-19 stress. COVID-19 stress and general mental distress were strongly related (r = .53). Both meaningfulness and self-control were negatively associated with general mental distress (r = −.40 and −.36, respectively). They also moderated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and general mental distress: When meaningfulness was high, high COVID-19 stress was related to substantially lower PHQ-4 scores than when meaningfulness was low. The same held for self-control: High scores of self-control were associated with lower PHQ-4 scores especially when COVID-19 stress was high. Crisis of meaning mediated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and PHQ-4. There was a higher likelihood of crises of meaning occurring when COVID-19 stress was high; crisis of meaning, in turn, was associated with general mental distress. Survey group moderated the first path of this mediation, i.e., the relationship between COVID-19 stress and crisis of meaning: High scores of COVID-19 stress were associated more strongly with crisis of meaning in the second survey group (after the lockdown). Self-control moderated the second path, i.e., the relationship between crisis of meaning and PHQ-4: When a crisis of meaning was present, self-control could buffer its effect on general mental distress.

Conclusions: Also in the present study among German-speaking participants, general mental distress was high. Scores were higher after than during the lockdown, indicating an ongoing destabilization for a significant part of the population. People who saw a meaning in their lives and who were capable of self-control reported substantially less mental distress. Meaningfulness and self-control also served as buffers between COVID-19 stress and general mental distress: When COVID-19 stress was high, the presence of meaningfulness and self-control accounted for lower general mental distress. Moreover, people who suffered strongly from COVID-19 stress were more likely to develop a crisis of meaning which, in turn, was associated with higher general mental distress. This suggests that ongoing anxiety and depression might (also) be based on existential struggles. Again here, self-control buffered the impact of crisis of meaning on general mental health. We conclude from these findings that public health policies can support citizens in coping with large-scale crises by enabling experiences of meaningfulness, e.g., through transparent and reliable modes of communicating goals and necessary intermediate steps. Moreover, health professionals are well advised to invite individuals to confront existential questions and struggles, and to encourage them to exercise self-control. The latter can be boosted by keeping higher-order goals salient—which again is inherently linked to an understanding of their meaning.",science,1,1603712586,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

We study the role of social connections in U.S. households’ compliance with mobility restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, using aggregated and anonymized Facebook data on social connections and mobile phone data for measuring social distancing at the county level. Relative to average, a one-standard-deviation increase in social connections with China and Italy - the first countries with major outbreaks of the virus - is associated with a nearly 50% increase in the estimated effect of mobility restrictions. Our results are not driven by traveler risk, as areas at higher risk from COVID-19 generally comply with restrictions more and are less affected by social connections. Social connections with counties with a less educated population, higher Trump vote share, and higher fraction of climate change deniers are associated with increased effects of mobility restrictions. Our findings are consistent with social networks contributing to people’s information acquisition about the pandemic.",science,1,1603712411,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Cell Stem Cell
Available online 21 October 2020

Summary

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the cause of a present global pandemic, infects human lung alveolar type 2 (hAT2) cells. Characterizing pathogenesis is crucial for developing vaccines and therapeutics. However, the lack of models mirroring the cellular physiology and pathology of hAT2 cells limits the study. Here, we develop a feeder-free, long-term three-dimensional (3D) culture technique for hAT2 cells derived from primary human lung tissue, and investigate infection response to SARS-CoV-2. By imaging-based analysis and single-cell transcriptome profiling, we reveal rapid viral replication and the increased expression of interferon-associated genes and pro-inflammatory genes in infected hAT2 cells, indicating robust endogenous innate immune response. Further tracing of viral mutations acquired during transmission identifies full infection of individual cells effectively from a single viral entry. Our study provides deep insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and the application of defined 3D hAT2 cultures as models for respiratory diseases.",science,1,1603621289,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

We identified patients (≥18 years) who completed a clinically indicated exercise stress test between 01 January 2016 and 29 February 2020 and had a test for SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test) between 29 February 2020 and 31 May 2020. Maximal exercise capacity was quantified in metabolic equivalents of task (METs). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the likelihood that hospitalization secondary to COVID-19 is related to peak METs, with adjustment for 13 covariates previously identified as associated with higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.

Results

We identified 246 patients (age= 59±12 years; 42% male; 75% black race) who had an exercise test and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among these, 89 (36%) were hospitalized. Peak METs were significantly lower (P &lt;.001) among patients who were hospitalized (6.7±2.8) compared to those not hospitalized (8.0±2.4). Peak METs were inversely associated with the likelihood of hospitalization in unadjusted (OR= 0.83, 95% CI= 0.74, 0.92) and adjusted models (OR= 0.87, 95% CI= 0.76, 0.99).

Conclusion

Maximal exercise capacity is independently and inversely associated with the likelihood of hospitalization due to COVID-19. These data further support the important relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and health outcomes. Future studies are needed to determine if improving maximal exercise capacity is associated with lower risk of complications due to viral infections, such as COVID-19.",science,1,1603619624,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Science Advances  23 Oct 2020:
eabc3054

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abc3054

Abstract

We study the role of social connections in U.S. households’ compliance with mobility restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, using aggregated and anonymized Facebook data on social connections and mobile phone data for measuring social distancing at the county level. Relative to average, a one-standard-deviation increase in social connections with China and Italy - the first countries with major outbreaks of the virus - is associated with a nearly 50% increase in the estimated effect of mobility restrictions. Our results are not driven by traveler risk, as areas at higher risk from COVID-19 generally comply with restrictions more and are less affected by social connections. Social connections with counties with a less educated population, higher Trump vote share, and higher fraction of climate change deniers are associated with increased effects of mobility restrictions. Our findings are consistent with social networks contributing to people’s information acquisition about the pandemic.

Discussion

We find robust evidence that U.S. counties with more social connections with the two countries most severely affected by COVID-19 early on, Italy and China, comply significantly more with mobility restrictions imposed by local governments.",science,1,1603619413,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

Background

The aim of this study is to use classification methods to predict future onset of Alzheimer's disease in cognitively normal subjects through automated linguistic analysis.

Methods

To study linguistic performance as an early biomarker of AD, we performed predictive modeling of future diagnosis of AD from a cognitively normal baseline of Framingham Heart Study participants. The linguistic variables were derived from written responses to the cookie-theft picture-description task. We compared the predictive performance of linguistic variables with clinical and neuropsychological variables. The study included 703 samples from 270 participants out of which a dataset consisting of a single sample from 80 participants was held out for testing. Half of the participants in the test set developed AD symptoms before 85 years old, while the other half did not. All samples in the test set were collected during the cognitively normal period (before MCI). The mean time to diagnosis of mild AD was 7.59 years.

Findings

Significant predictive power was obtained, with AUC of 0.74 and accuracy of 0.70 when using linguistic variables. The linguistic variables most relevant for predicting onset of AD have been identified in the literature as associated with cognitive decline in dementia.

Interpretation

The results suggest that language performance in naturalistic probes expose subtle early sings of progression to AD in advance of clinical diagnosis of impairment.

Discussion

Our results demonstrate that it is possible to predict future onset of Alzheimer's disease using language samples obtained from cognitively normal individuals.",science,1,1603534078,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

We use COVID-19 case and mortality data from 1 February 2020 to 21 September 2020 and a deterministic SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered) compartmental framework to model possible trajectories of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the United States at the state level from 22 September 2020 through 28 February 2021. Using this SEIR model, and projections of critical driving covariates (pneumonia seasonality, mobility, testing rates and mask use per capita), we assessed scenarios of social distancing mandates and levels of mask use. Projections of current non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies by state—with social distancing mandates reinstated when a threshold of 8 deaths per million population is exceeded (reference scenario)—suggest that, cumulatively, 511,373 (469,578–578,347) lives could be lost to COVID-19 across the United States by 28 February 2021. We find that achieving universal mask use (95% mask use in public) could be sufficient to ameliorate the worst effects of epidemic resurgences in many states. Universal mask use could save an additional 129,574 (85,284–170,867) lives from September 22, 2020 through the end of February 2021, or an additional 95,814 (60,731–133,077) lives assuming a lesser adoption of mask wearing (85%), when compared to the reference scenario.",science,4,1603503327,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

BMJ 2020; 371 

doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3939 (Published 22 October 2020)

Abstract

Objective To investigate the effectiveness of using convalescent plasma to treat moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in adults in India.

Design Open label, parallel arm, phase II, multicentre, randomised controlled trial.

Setting 39 public and private hospitals across India.

Participants 464 adults (≥18 years) admitted to hospital (screened 22 April to 14 July 2020) with confirmed moderate covid-19 (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio between 200 mm Hg and 300 mm Hg or a respiratory rate of more than 24/min with oxygen saturation 93% or less on room air): 235 were assigned to convalescent plasma with best standard of care (intervention arm) and 229 to best standard of care only (control arm).

Interventions Participants in the intervention arm received two doses of 200 mL convalescent plasma, transfused 24 hours apart. The presence and levels of neutralising antibodies were not measured a priori; stored samples were assayed at the end of the study.

Main outcome measure Composite of progression to severe disease (PaO2/FiO2 &lt;100 mm Hg) or all cause mortality at 28 days post-enrolment.

Results Progression to severe disease or all cause mortality at 28 days after enrolment occurred in 44 (19%) participants in the intervention arm and 41 (18%) in the control arm (risk difference 0.008 (95% confidence interval −0.062 to 0.078); risk ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.54).

Conclusion Convalescent plasma was not associated with a reduction in progression to severe covid-19 or all cause mortality. This trial has high generalisability and approximates convalescent plasma use in real life settings with limited laboratory capacity. A priori measurement of neutralising antibody titres in donors and participants might further clarify the role of convalescent plasma in the management of covid-19.",science,1,1603443986,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Additive effects of green tea and coffee on all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: the Fukuoka Diabetes Registry 

BMJ Open Diabetes Research and Care 2020;8:e001252. 

doi: 10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001252

Abstract

Introduction The impact of consuming green tea or coffee on mortality in patients with diabetes is controversial. We prospectively investigated the impact of each beverage and their combination on mortality among Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research design and methods In all, 4923 patients (2790 men, 2133 women) with type 2 diabetes (mean age, 66 years) were followed prospectively (median, 5.3 years; follow-up rate, 99.5%). We evaluated the amount of green tea and coffee consumed using self-administered questionnaires.

Results During the follow-up period, 309 participants died. The consumption of green tea, coffee, and a combination of the beverages was associated with reduced all-cause mortality. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for green tea were as follows: none 1.0 (referent); 0.85 (0.60–1.22) for ≤1 cup/day; 0.73 (0.51–1.03) for 2–3 cups/day; 0.60 (0.42–0.85) for ≥4 cups/day; and P for trend, 0.002. For coffee, they were: none 1.0 (referent); 0.88 (0.66–1.18) for &lt;1 cup/day; 0.81 (0.58–1.13) for 1 cup/day; 0.59 (0.42–0.82) for ≥2 cups/day; P for trend, 0.002. With the combination they were 1.0 (referent) for no consumption of green tea and coffee; 0.49 (0.24–0.99) for 2–3 cups/day of green tea with ≥2 cups/day of coffee; 0.42 (0.20–0.88) for ≥4 cups/day of green tea with 1 cup/day of coffee; and 0.37 (0.18–0.77) for ≥4 cups/day of green tea with ≥2 cups/day of coffee.

Conclusions Higher consumption of green tea and coffee was associated with reduced all-cause mortality: their combined effect appeared to be additive in patients with type 2 diabetes.",science,1,1603370352,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

We report a superspreading event of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection initiated at a bar in Vietnam with evidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, based on ministry of health reports, patient interviews, and whole-genome sequence analysis. Crowds in enclosed indoor settings with poor ventilation may be considered at high risk for transmission.
Superspreading events occur when a few persons infect a larger number of secondary persons with whom they have contact (1,2). For severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an R0 of 2–3 with 6–8 secondary cases has been suggested to constitute a superspreading event (3).

Although SARS-CoV-2 is known to be transmitted through droplets and fomites, there has been growing evidence of airborne transmission (4,5). Better understanding of specific settings in which superspreading events are facilitated remains critical to inform the development and implementation of control measures to avoid future waves of the pandemic (5).

On March 18, 2020, a 43-year old man, patient 1, sought treatment at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, for fever, cough, muscle aches, fatigue, and headache. A sample from a nasopharyngeal throat swab specimen taken at admission tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription PCR.

During the 14 days before the onset of his symptoms on March 17, he had traveled to Thailand and within Vietnam, between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. From 10:00 PM on March 14 until 2:30 AM of the next day, he participated in a St. Patrick’s Day celebration at bar X in Ho Chi Minh City. The bar had 2 indoor areas for clients, an »300-m2 area downstairs and an »50-m2 area upstairs, with no mechanical ventilation. During open hours, the left and right entrances were typically kept closed to facilitate cooling with air conditioners that recycle indoor air; the middle entrance was kept open. The bar also has naturally ventilated outdoor spaces (Appendix). Patient 1 was inside the bar during the party.",science,1,1603370171,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

DOI: https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305869

Abstract

Objectives. To understand changes in how Facebook pages frame vaccine opposition.

Methods. We categorized 204 Facebook pages expressing vaccine opposition, extracting public posts through November 20, 2019. We analyzed posts from October 2009 through October 2019 to examine if pages’ content was coalescing.

Results. Activity in pages promoting vaccine choice as a civil liberty increased in January 2015, April 2016, and January 2019 (t[76] = 11.33 [P &lt; .001]; t[46] = 7.88 [P &lt; .001]; and t[41] = 17.27 [P &lt; .001], respectively). The 2019 increase was strongest in pages mentioning US states (t[41] = 19.06; P &lt; .001). Discussion about vaccine safety decreased (rs[119] = −0.61; P &lt; .001) while discussion about civil liberties increased (rs[119] = 0.33; Py &lt; .001]). Page categories increasingly resembled one another (civil liberties: rs[119] = −0.50 [P &lt; .001]; alternative medicine: rs[84] = −0.77 [P &lt; .001]; conspiracy theories: rs[119] = −0.46 [P &lt; .001]; morality: rs[106] = −0.65 [P &lt; .001]; safety and efficacy: rs[119] = −0.46 [P &lt; .001]).

Conclusions. The “Disneyland” measles outbreak drew vaccine opposition into the political mainstream, followed by promotional campaigns conducted in pages framing vaccine refusal as a civil right. Political mobilization in state-focused pages followed in 2019.

Abstract

Human sleep/wake cycles follow a stable circadian rhythm associated with hormonal, emotional, and cognitive changes. Changes of this cycle are implicated in many mental health concerns. In fact, the bidirectional relation between major depressive disorder and sleep has been well-documented. Despite a clear link between sleep disturbances and subsequent disturbances in mood, it is difficult to determine from self-reported data which specific changes of the sleep/wake cycle play the most important role in this association. Here we observe marked changes of activity cycles in millions of twitter posts of 688 subjects who explicitly stated in unequivocal terms that they had received a (clinical) diagnosis of depression as compared to the activity cycles of a large control group (n = 8791). Rather than a phase-shift, as reported in other work, we find significant changes of activity levels in the evening and before dawn. Compared to the control group, depressed subjects were significantly more active from 7 PM to midnight and less active from 3 to 6 AM. Content analysis of tweets revealed a steady rise in rumination and emotional content from midnight to dawn among depressed individuals. These results suggest that diagnosis and treatment of depression may focus on modifying the timing of activity, reducing rumination, and decreasing social media use at specific hours of the day.",science,1,1603359034,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Key Points

Question  What factors are associated with US adults’ choice of and willingness to accept a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine?

Findings  In this survey study of a national sample of 1971 US adults, vaccine-related attributes (eg, vaccine efficacy, adverse effects, and protection duration) and political factors (eg, US Food and Drug Administration approval process, national origin of vaccine, and endorsements) were associated with preferences for choosing a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Health care attitudes and practices, political partisanship, and demographic characteristics, including age, sex, and race/ethnicity, were also associated with willingness to receive a vaccination.

Meaning  The results of this survey study may help inform public health campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy.

Abstract

Importance  The development of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine has progressed at unprecedented speed. Widespread public uptake of the vaccine is crucial to stem the pandemic.

Objective  To examine the factors associated with survey participants’ self-reported likelihood of selecting and receiving a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine.

Design, Setting, and Participants  A survey study of a nonprobability convenience sample of 2000 recruited participants including a choice-based conjoint analysis was conducted to estimate respondents’ probability of choosing a vaccine and willingness to receive vaccination. Participants were asked to evaluate their willingness to receive each hypothetical vaccine individually. The survey presented respondents with 5 choice tasks. In each, participants evaluated 2 hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines and were asked whether they would choose vaccine A, vaccine B, or neither vaccine. Vaccine attributes included efficacy, protection duration, major adverse effects, minor adverse effects, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, national origin of vaccine, and endorsement. Levels of each attribute for each vaccine were randomly assigned, and attribute order was randomized across participants. Survey data were collected on July 9, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Average marginal component effect sizes and marginal means were calculated to estimate the relationship between each vaccine attribute level and the probability of the respondent choosing a vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination.

Results  A total of 1971 US adults responded to the survey (median age, 43 [interquartile range, 30-58] years); 999 (51%) were women, 1432 (73%) White, 277 (14%) were Black, and 190 (10%) were Latinx. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 70% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.06-0.09), and an increase from 50% to 90% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.15-0.18). An increase in protection duration from 1 to 5 years was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.05 95% CI, 0.04-0.07). A decrease in the incidence of major adverse effects from 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 1 000 000 was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05-0.08). An FDA emergency use authorization was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, −0.03; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.01) compared with full FDA approval. A vaccine that originated from a non-US country was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (China: −0.13 [95% CI, −0.15 to −0.11]; UK: −0.04 [95% CI, −0.06 to −0.02]). Endorsements from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (coefficient, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.07-0.11) and the World Health Organization (coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.04-0.08), compared with an endorsement from President Trump were associated with higher probabilities of choosing a vaccine. Analyses of participants’ willingness to receive each vaccine when assessed individually yielded similar results. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 90% was associated with a 10% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.51 to 0.61). A reduction in the incidence of major side effects was associated with a 4% higher marginal mean willingness to receive a vaccine (from 0.54 to 0.58). A vaccine originating in China was associated with a 10% lower willingness to receive a vaccine vs one developed in the US (from 0.60 to 0.50) Endorsements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization were associated with increases in willingness to receive a vaccine (7% and 6%, respectively) from a baseline endorsement by President Trump (from 0.52 to 0.59 and from 0.52 to 0.58, respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance  In this survey study of US adults, vaccine-related attributes and political characteristics were associated with self-reported preferences for choosing a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination.

Key Points

Question  What factors are associated with US adults’ choice of and willingness to accept a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine?

Findings  In this survey study of a national sample of 1971 US adults, vaccine-related attributes (eg, vaccine efficacy, adverse effects, and protection duration) and political factors (eg, US Food and Drug Administration approval process, national origin of vaccine, and endorsements) were associated with preferences for choosing a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Health care attitudes and practices, political partisanship, and demographic characteristics, including age, sex, and race/ethnicity, were also associated with willingness to receive a vaccination.

Meaning  The results of this survey study may help inform public health campaigns to address vaccine hesitancy.

Abstract

Importance  The development of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine has progressed at unprecedented speed. Widespread public uptake of the vaccine is crucial to stem the pandemic.

Objective  To examine the factors associated with survey participants’ self-reported likelihood of selecting and receiving a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine.

Design, Setting, and Participants  A survey study of a nonprobability convenience sample of 2000 recruited participants including a choice-based conjoint analysis was conducted to estimate respondents’ probability of choosing a vaccine and willingness to receive vaccination. Participants were asked to evaluate their willingness to receive each hypothetical vaccine individually. The survey presented respondents with 5 choice tasks. In each, participants evaluated 2 hypothetical COVID-19 vaccines and were asked whether they would choose vaccine A, vaccine B, or neither vaccine. Vaccine attributes included efficacy, protection duration, major adverse effects, minor adverse effects, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, national origin of vaccine, and endorsement. Levels of each attribute for each vaccine were randomly assigned, and attribute order was randomized across participants. Survey data were collected on July 9, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Average marginal component effect sizes and marginal means were calculated to estimate the relationship between each vaccine attribute level and the probability of the respondent choosing a vaccine and self-reported willingness to receive vaccination.

Results  A total of 1971 US adults responded to the survey (median age, 43 [interquartile range, 30-58] years); 999 (51%) were women, 1432 (73%) White, 277 (14%) were Black, and 190 (10%) were Latinx. An increase in efficacy from 50% to 70% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.06-0.09), and an increase from 50% to 90% was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.15-0.18). An increase in protection duration from 1 to 5 years was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.05 95% CI, 0.04-0.07). A decrease in the incidence of major adverse effects from 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 1 000 000 was associated with a higher probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.05-0.08). An FDA emergency use authorization was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (coefficient, −0.03; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.01) compared with full FDA approval. A vaccine that originated from a non-US country was associated with a lower probability of choosing a vaccine (China: −0.13 [95% CI, −0.15 to −0.11]; UK: −0.04 [95% CI, −0.06 to −0.02]). Endorsements from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (coefficient, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.07-0.11) and the World Health Organization (coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.04-0.08), compared with an endorsement from President Trump were associated with higher probabilities of choosing a vaccine.

Published online: 23 September 2020

The initial months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic have led to an unprecedented response from the global medical research community.1 Simultaneously, there have been concerns about the rapid publication of misleading, biased studies.2 We systematically evaluated the early global research response to COVID‐19 by characterising the methodological quality of registered COVID‐19 studies. We also compared the research response with previous respiratory viral epidemics: the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus pandemic.

The global research response to COVID‐19 has been substantially larger than that observed with previous epidemics and pandemics. The potential drivers of this include the absence of proven therapies,3 ease of transmissibility,4 rapidity of global spread, and high hospitalisation and mortality rate5 coupled with greater pandemic preparedness and ease of greater global collaboration. It is concerning that only a minority of trials adhered to established markers of internal validity, such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo where applicable, and a data safety monitoring committee presence.

While the global research response to COVID‐19 has been rapid and substantial, due to methodological insufficiencies, many studies of interventions may not lead to high quality evidence to guide treatment of COVID‐19. Resulting publications from these studies and reasons for discontinuation of studies would be of interest for future investigation. There was significant duplication with multiple trials of several interventions. The impact on non‐COVID‐19 research has been substantial.",science,2,1603321665,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

ABSTRACT

The present study investigates aerosol transport and surface deposition in a realistic classroom environment using computational fluid-particle dynamics simulations. Effects of particle size, aerosol source location, glass barriers, and windows are explored. While aerosol transport in air exhibits some stochasticity, it is found that a significant fraction (24%–50%) of particles smaller than 15 µm exit the system within 15 min through the air conditioning system. Particles larger than 20 µm almost entirely deposit on the ground, desks, and nearby surfaces in the room. Source location strongly influences the trajectory and deposition distribution of the exhaled aerosol particles and affects the effectiveness of mitigation measures such as glass barriers. Glass barriers are found to reduce the aerosol transmission of 1 µm particles from the source individual to others separated by at least 2.4 m by ∼92%. By opening windows, the particle exit fraction can be increased by ∼38% compared to the case with closed windows and reduces aerosol deposition on people in the room. On average, ∼69% of 1 µm particles exit the system when the windows are open.",science,1,1603275635,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

Several coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are currently in human trials. In June 2020, we surveyed 13,426 people in 19 countries to determine potential acceptance rates and factors influencing acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. Of these, 71.5% of participants reported that they would be very or somewhat likely to take a COVID-19 vaccine, and 61.4% reported that they would accept their employer’s recommendation to do so. Differences in acceptance rates ranged from almost 90% (in China) to less than 55% (in Russia). Respondents reporting higher levels of trust in information from government sources were more likely to accept a vaccine and take their employer’s advice to do so.",science,1,1603275227,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

ABSTRACT

The cough of a COVID-19 infected subject contaminates a large volume of surrounding air with coronavirus due to the entrainment of surrounding air in the jet-like flow created by the cough. In the present work, we estimate this volume of the air, which may help us to design ventilation of closed spaces and, consequently, reduce the spread of the disease. Recent experiments [P. P. Simha and P. S. M. Rao, “Universal trends in human cough airflows at large distances,” Phys. Fluids 32, 081905 (2020)] have shown that the velocity in a cough-cloud decays exponentially with distance. We analyze the data further to estimate the volume of the cough-cloud in the presence and absence of a face mask. Assuming a self-similar nature of the cough-cloud, we find that the volume entrained in the cloud varies as 𝕍=0.666c2d3c

, where c is the spread rate and dc is the final distance traveled by the cough-cloud. The volume of the cough-cloud without a mask is about 7 and 23 times larger than in the presence of a surgical mask and an N95 mask, respectively. We also find that the cough-cloud is present for 5 s–8 s, after which the cloud starts dissipating, irrespective of the presence or absence of a mask. Our analysis suggests that the cough-cloud finally attains the room temperature, while remaining slightly more moist than the surrounding. These findings are expected to have implications in understanding the spread of coronavirus, which is reportedly airborne.",science,1,1603274954,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

Introduction: In the absence of effective antivirals and vaccination, the pandemic of COVID-19 remains the most significant challenge to our health care system in decades. There is an urgent need for definitive therapeutic intervention. Clinical reports indicate that the cytokine storm associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality in severe cases of some respiratory viral infections, including COVID-19. In recent years, cannabinoids have been investigated extensively due to their potential effects on the human body. Among all cannabinoids, cannabidiol (CBD) has demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of pathological conditions. Therefore, it is logical to explore whether CBD can reduce the cytokine storm and treat ARDS.

Materials and Methods: In this study, we show that intranasal application of Poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA, simulated symptoms of severe viral infections inducing signs of ARDS and cytokine storm.

Discussion: The administration of CBD downregulated the level of proinflammatory cytokines and ameliorated the clinical symptoms of Poly I:C-induced ARDS.

Conclusion: Our results suggest a potential protective role for CBD during ARDS that may extend CBD as part of the treatment of COVID-19 by reducing the cytokine storm, protecting pulmonary tissues, and re-establishing inflammatory homeostasis.",science,6,1603236833,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

How personality and policy predict pandemic behavior: Understanding sheltering-in-place in 55 countries at the onset of COVID-19. 

American Psychologist. 18 October 2020

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/amp0000740

Abstract

The spread of COVID-19 within any given country or community at the onset of the pandemic depended in part on the sheltering-in-place rate of its citizens. The pandemic led us to revisit one of psychology’s most fundamental and most basic questions in a high-stakes context: what determines human behavior? Adopting a Lewinian interactionist lens, we investigate the independent and joint effects of macrolevel government policies and microlevel psychological factors—that is, personality—on whether individuals sheltered-in-place. We analyzed data collected in late March and early April 2020 from 101,005 participants in 55 countries, a time period that coincided with the early and accelerating stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. This time period also contained substantial variation in the stringency of governmental policy toward sheltering-in-place, both between countries and within each country over time. Analyses revealed that personality and the stringency of governmental policies independently predicted sheltering-in-place rates. Policy stringency was positively related to sheltering-in-place. For the personality dimensions, Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism all predicted higher rates of sheltering-in-place, whereas Extraversion was negatively related to staying at home. In addition, two personality traits—Openness to Experience and Neuroticism—interacted with governmental policy to predict whether individuals sheltered-in-place; openness and neuroticism each had weaker effects on sheltering-in-place as governmental policies became stricter. Theoretically, the findings demonstrate that individual differences predict behavior (i.e., sheltering-in-place) even when governments take strong action targeting that behavior. Practically, they suggest that even if governments lift their shelter-in-place restrictions, some individuals will shelter-in-place less than others.

Public Significance Statement

To curb the spread of current and recurrent waves of COVID-19, individuals must stay at home when the circumstances require it. In a large-scale global sample, we demonstrate how individual personality and policy stringency jointly and independently determine whether or not someone will shelter-in-place. Our findings suggest that as governments provisionally relax sheltering-in-place restrictions, some individuals will continue to engage in social distancing behaviors more than others.",science,1,1603102395,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Metallodrug ranitidine bismuth citrate suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication and relieves virus-associated pneumonia in Syrian hamsters. 

Nature Microbiology (2020). 

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-00802-x

Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 is causing a pandemic of COVID-19, with high infectivity and significant mortality1. Currently, therapeutic options for COVID-19 are limited. Historically, metal compounds have found use as antimicrobial agents, but their antiviral activities have rarely been explored. Here, we test a set of metallodrugs and related compounds, and identify ranitidine bismuth citrate, a commonly used drug for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, as a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent, both in vitro and in vivo. Ranitidine bismuth citrate exhibited low cytotoxicity and protected SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with a high selectivity index of 975. Importantly, ranitidine bismuth citrate suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication, leading to decreased viral loads in both upper and lower respiratory tracts, and relieved virus-associated pneumonia in a golden Syrian hamster model. In vitro studies showed that ranitidine bismuth citrate and its related compounds exhibited inhibition towards both the ATPase (IC50 = 0.69 µM) and DNA-unwinding (IC50 = 0.70 µM) activities of the SARS-CoV-2 helicase via an irreversible displacement of zinc(II) ions from the enzyme by bismuth(III) ions. Our findings highlight viral helicase as a druggable target and the clinical potential of bismuth(III) drugs or other metallodrugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",science,1,1603026677,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Immunity. Published:October 13, 2020

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.10.004

Highlights

• Using independent SARS-CoV-2 antigens improves specificity of serological assays

• Neutralizing and spike-specific antibody production persists for at least 5-7 months

• Nucleocapsid antibodies frequently become undetectable by 5-7 months

• Antibody production is higher in severe disease relative to mild cases

Summary

We conducted a serological study to define correlates of immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Relative to mild COVID-19 cases, individuals with severe disease exhibited elevated virus-neutralizing titers and antibodies against nucleocapsid (N) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein. Age and sex played lesser roles. All cases, including asymptomatic individuals, seroconverted by 2 weeks post-PCR confirmation. Spike RBD and S2 and neutralizing antibodies remained detectable through 5-7 months post-onset, whereas α-N titers diminished. Testing of 5882 members of the local community revealed only 1 sample with seroreactivity to both RBD and S2 that lacked neutralizing antibodies. This fidelity could not be achieved with either RBD or S2 alone. Thus, inclusion of multiple independent assays improved the accuracy of antibody tests in low seroprevalence communities and revealed differences in antibody kinetics depending on the antigen. We conclude that neutralizing antibodies are stably produced for at least 5-7 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.",science,1,1603015116,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Association of cardiovascular disease and 10 other pre-existing comorbidities with COVID-19 mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis. 

PLoS ONE 15(8): e0238215. 

doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0238215

Abstract

Background

Estimating the risk of pre-existing comorbidities on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality may promote the importance of targeting populations at risk to improve survival. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the association of pre-existing comorbidities with COVID-19 mortality.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, OVID, and Cochrane Library databases, and medrxiv.org from December 1st, 2019, to July 9th, 2020. The outcome of interest was the risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients with and without pre-existing comorbidities. We analyzed 11 comorbidities: cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and HIV/AIDS. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. All analyses were performed using random-effects models and heterogeneity was quantified.

Results

Eleven pre-existing comorbidities from 25 studies were included in the meta-analysis (n = 65, 484 patients with COVID-19; mean age; 61 years; 57% male). Overall, the between-study heterogeneity was medium, and studies had low publication bias and high quality. Cardiovascular disease (risk ratio (RR) 2.25, 95% CI = 1.60–3.17, number of studies (n) = 14), hypertension (1.82 [1.43 to 2.32], n = 13), diabetes (1.48 [1.02 to 2.15], n = 16), congestive heart failure (2.03 [1.28 to 3.21], n = 3), chronic kidney disease (3.25 [1.13 to 9.28)], n = 9) and cancer (1.47 [1.01 to 2.14), n = 10) were associated with a significantly greater risk of mortality from COVID-19.

Conclusions

Patients with COVID-19 with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease and cancer have a greater risk of mortality compared to patients with COVID-19 without these comorbidities. Tailored infection prevention and treatment strategies targeting this high-risk population might improve survival.",science,1,1603014411,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Demographic Characteristics, Experiences, and Beliefs Associated with Hand Hygiene Among Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic — United States, June 24–30, 2020. 

MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2020;69:1485–1491. 

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6941a3

Summary

What is already known about this topic?

Hand hygiene, including handwashing with soap and water and using hand sanitizer containing ≥60% alcohol, is one measure recommended to prevent COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.

What is added by this report?

In an Internet-based survey, approximately 85% of 4,817 U.S. adults reported frequent hand hygiene after contact with public surfaces. Males, young adults, respondents with lower concern about risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and respondents without personal COVID-19 experience reported less frequent hand hygiene.

What are the implications for public health practice?

COVID-19 messages should continue promoting hand hygiene, particularly among men and young adults. Messages addressing COVID-19 risk perceptions and making handwashing accessible and hand sanitizer available by facilities in public settings should be considered to encourage and facilitate hand hygiene.",science,1,1602892573,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Significance

Public health response to COVID-19 requires behavior changes—isolation at home, wearing masks. Its effectiveness depends on generalized compliance. Original data from two waves of a survey conducted in March−April 2020 in eight Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries (n = 21,649) show large gender differences in COVID-19−related beliefs and behaviors. Women are more likely to perceive the pandemic as a very serious health problem and to agree and comply with restraining measures. These differences are only partially mitigated for individuals cohabiting or directly exposed to COVID-19. This behavioral factor contributes to substantial gender differences in mortality and is consistent with women-led countries responding more effectively to the pandemic. It calls for gender-based public health policies and communication.",science,0,1602891448,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Summary
Recent work has demonstrated adsorption-based solar-thermal-driven atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) in arid regions, but the daily water productivity (L/m 2/day) of devices remains low. We developed and tested a dual-stage AWH device with optimized transport. By recovering the latent heat of condensation of the top stage and maintaining the required temperature difference between stages, the design enables higher daily water productivity than a single-stage device without auxiliary units for heating or vapor transport. In outdoor experiments, we demonstrated a dual-stage water harvesting device using commercial zeolite (AQSOA Z01) and regeneration under natural, unconcentrated sunlight where ∼0.77 L/m 2/day of water was harvested. Our modeling showed that by further increasing top-stage temperatures via design modifications, approximately twice the daily productivity of the single-stage configuration can be achieved. This dual-stage device configuration is a promising design approach to achieve high performance, scalable, and low-cost solar-thermal AWH.",science,1,1602851629,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed many social, economic, environmental and healthcare determinants of health. We applied an ensemble of 16 Bayesian models to vital statistics data to estimate the all-cause mortality effect of the pandemic for 21 industrialized countries. From mid-February through May 2020, 206,000 (95% credible interval, 178,100–231,000) more people died in these countries than would have had the pandemic not occurred. The number of excess deaths, excess deaths per 100,000 people and relative increase in deaths were similar between men and women in most countries.

g8zn8fe,mvea,"Dual-Stage Atmospheric Water Harvesting Device for Scalable Solar-Driven Water Production

Joule Published:October 14, 2020

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2020.09.008

Highlights

• Developed dual-stage device with daily water harvesting productivity of ∼0.77 L/m 2/day

• Demonstrated productivity can be twice the single-stage device by heat loss reduction

• Provided model framework and guidelines to utilize higher performing adsorbents

Summary

Recent work has demonstrated adsorption-based solar-thermal-driven atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) in arid regions, but the daily water productivity (L/m 2/day) of devices remains low. We developed and tested a dual-stage AWH device with optimized transport. By recovering the latent heat of condensation of the top stage and maintaining the required temperature difference between stages, the design enables higher daily water productivity than a single-stage device without auxiliary units for heating or vapor transport. In outdoor experiments, we demonstrated a dual-stage water harvesting device using commercial zeolite (AQSOA Z01) and regeneration under natural, unconcentrated sunlight where ∼0.77 L/m 2/day of water was harvested. Our modeling showed that by further increasing top-stage temperatures via design modifications, approximately twice the daily productivity of the single-stage configuration can be achieved. This dual-stage device configuration is a promising design approach to achieve high performance, scalable, and low-cost solar-thermal AWH.",science,1,1602844680,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed many social, economic, environmental and healthcare determinants of health. We applied an ensemble of 16 Bayesian models to vital statistics data to estimate the all-cause mortality effect of the pandemic for 21 industrialized countries. From mid-February through May 2020, 206,000 (95% credible interval, 178,100–231,000) more people died in these countries than would have had the pandemic not occurred. The number of excess deaths, excess deaths per 100,000 people and relative increase in deaths were similar between men and women in most countries. England and Wales and Spain experienced the largest effect: ~100 excess deaths per 100,000 people, equivalent to a 37% (30–44%) relative increase in England and Wales and 38% (31–45%) in Spain.

MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep October 16, 2020 / 69(41);1492–1493

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6941a4

On June 16, 2020, a recreational ice hockey game was played at an ice rink in the Tampa Bay, Florida, metropolitan area. Teams A and B, each consisting of 11 players (typically six on the ice and five on the bench at any given time), included men aged 19–53 years. During the 5 days after the game, 15 persons (14 of the 22 players and a rink staff member) experienced signs and symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)*; 13 of the 15 ill persons had positive laboratory test results indicating infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been documented at a choir practice (1) and at meat processing plants (2,3); however, apart from an outbreak involving 57 infected dancers that has been linked to high-intensity fitness dance classes in South Korea (4) and a cluster of five infected persons at a squash facility in Slovenia (5), few published reports are available regarding transmission associated with specific sports games or practices. In addition, outbreaks of COVID-19 infections among amateur hockey players in the United States have recently been reported in the news.†

On June 19, 2020, the Florida Department of Health was notified of a team A player (the index patient) who experienced fever, cough, sore throat, and a headache beginning on June 17, the day after he had participated in an evening game; 2 days later, a nasal specimen was obtained, which tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (https://www.quidel.com/immunoassays/coronavirusexternal icon). An investigation by the Florida Department of Health revealed that eight of 10 team A players (excluding the index patient), five of 11 players from team B, and one rink staff member experienced COVID-19 signs and symptoms during June 18–21 (Figure), 2–5 days after the game. Excluding the index patient, 13 of the 21 (62%) players experienced illness. Among the 15 total cases in this outbreak, 11 patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction results, two had positive antigen tests,§ and two were not tested.¶ Asymptomatic players did not seek testing. Neither of the two on-ice referees experienced symptoms. Because the investigation was deemed public health practice, approval by the Florida Department of Health Institutional Review Board was not required.

Ice hockey involves vigorous physical exertion accompanied by deep, heavy respiration, and during the game, players frequently move from the ice surface to the bench while still breathing heavily. In this game, hockey-specific face protection varied and included metal cages or plastic half-shields (covering the eyes and the upper part of the nose); some players do not wear face protection. Cloth face masks for disease control were not used in the locker rooms or during the game. A standard ice rink in the United States measures 200 feet (61 meters) by 85 feet (26 meters). Boards and plexiglass, extending upward to approximately 10 feet (3 meters), surround the ice surface creating a physically segregated playing area. In addition to the 60-minute game time on the ice, during which players frequently came within 6 feet of one another, each team used a separate locker room, typically for 20 minutes before and after the game. Players from the teams did not have other common exposures in the week before the game. The median incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 4–5 days from exposure to symptom onset and ranges from 2–14 days.** Although more than one player might have been infectious during the game, it is hypothesized that the index patient was the source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission for the other players while he was presymptomatic.

The ice rink provides a venue that is likely well suited to COVID-19 transmission as an indoor environment where deep breathing occurs, and persons are in close proximity to one another. An Italian study estimating the rate of SARS-CoV-2 emission by infectious persons based on viral load in the mouth showed that during heavy exercise, a high viral emission rate can be reached during oral breathing (6). The higher proportion of infected players on the index patient’s team might result from additional exposures to the index patient in the locker room and on the player bench, where players sit close to one another.

A limitation of this investigation was that not all players from the game sought testing, and asymptomatic infections were possibly not identified. The indoor space and close contact between players during a hockey game increase infection risk for players and create potential for a superspreader event, especially with ongoing community COVID-19 transmission. Superspreader events, in which one infectious person infects many others, can lead to explosive growth at the beginning of an outbreak and facilitate sustained transmission later in an outbreak (7). This game involved a relatively limited number of players and only one spectator, who remained symptom-free and was not tested (the limited number of spectators was not related to rink policy); however, hockey games can include up to 20 players on each of the two teams and many spectators in the arena.

The high proportion of infections that occurred in this outbreak provides evidence for SARS-CoV-2 transmission during an indoor sporting activity where intense physical activity is occurring. In response, Florida Department of Health staff members provided isolation and quarantine recommendations to the persons in the rink during the game and advised ice rink management on COVID-19 risk and disease control.",science,1,1602841963,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society

First published: 12 October 2020

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.16894

Abstract

Background

Clinical presentation and risk factors of death in COVID‐19 in oldest adults have not been well characterized.

Objectives

To describe clinical features and outcome of COVID‐19 in patients above the age of 85 years and study risk factors for mortality.

Design

Prospective cohort.

Participants and setting

Patients, 85 years and older admitted in non‐critical care units at the University Hospital Lariboisière Fernand‐Widal (Paris, France) for confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were included and followed for 21 days.

Measurements

Clinical and laboratory findings were collected. Cox survival analysis was performed to explore factors associated with death.

Results

From March 14th to April 9th, 76 patients (median age: 90 [86‐92]; women: 55.3%) were admitted for confirmed COVID‐19. 64.5% of patients presented with 3 or more comorbidities. Most common symptoms were asthenia (76.3%), fever (75.0%), confusion and delirium (71.1%). Inaugural fall was reported in 25.0% of cases and digestive symptoms in 22.4%. COVID‐19 was severe in 51.3% of cases, moderate in 32.9% and mild in 15.8%. Complications included acute respiratory syndrome (28.9%), cardiac decompensation (14.5%) and hypotensive shock (9.0%). Fatality at 21 days was 28.9%, after a median course of disease of 13 (8‐17) days. Males were overrepresented in non‐survivors (68.2%). In survivors, median length of stay was 12 (9‐19.5) days. Independent predictive factors of death were CRP level at admission and lymphocytes count at nadir.

Conclusion

Specific clinical features, multi‐organ injury and high case fatality rate are observed in older adults with COVID‐19. Rapid diagnosis, appropriate care and monitoring seem however to improve prognosis.",science,1,1602841767,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.08.041

Abstract

Background

Thromboembolic disease is common in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). There is limited evidence on the association of in-hospital anticoagulation (AC) with outcomes and postmortem findings.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine association of AC with in-hospital outcomes and describe thromboembolic findings on autopsies.

Methods

This retrospective analysis examined the association of AC with mortality, intubation, and major bleeding. Subanalyses were also conducted on the association of therapeutic versus prophylactic AC initiated ≤48 h from admission. Thromboembolic disease was contextualized by premortem AC among consecutive autopsies.

Results

Among 4,389 patients, median age was 65 years with 44% women. Compared with no AC (n = 1,530; 34.9%), therapeutic AC (n = 900; 20.5%) and prophylactic AC (n = 1,959; 44.6%) were associated with lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45 to 0.62 and aHR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.57, respectively), and intubation (aHR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.94 and aHR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.89, respectively). When initiated ≤48 h from admission, there was no statistically significant difference between therapeutic (n = 766) versus prophylactic AC (n = 1,860) (aHR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.02; p = 0.08). Overall, 89 patients (2%) had major bleeding adjudicated by clinician review, with 27 of 900 (3.0%) on therapeutic, 33 of 1,959 (1.7%) on prophylactic, and 29 of 1,530 (1.9%) on no AC. Of 26 autopsies, 11 (42%) had thromboembolic disease not clinically suspected and 3 of 11 (27%) were on therapeutic AC.

Conclusions

AC was associated with lower mortality and intubation among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Compared with prophylactic AC, therapeutic AC was associated with lower mortality, although not statistically significant. Autopsies revealed frequent thromboembolic disease. These data may inform trials to determine optimal AC regimens.",science,1,1602841489,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

An urgent global quest for effective therapies to prevent and treat COVID-19 disease is ongoing. We previously described REGN-COV2, a cocktail of two potent neutralizing antibodies (REGN10987+REGN10933) targeting non-overlapping epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In this report, we evaluate the in vivo efficacy of this antibody cocktail in both rhesus macaques, which may model mild disease, and golden hamsters, which may model more severe disease. We demonstrate that REGN-COV-2 can greatly reduce virus load in lower and upper airways and decrease virus induced pathological sequalae when administered prophylactically or therapeutically in rhesus macaques. Similarly, administration in hamsters limits weight loss and decreases lung titers and evidence of pneumonia in the lungs. Our results provide evidence of the therapeutic potential of this antibody cocktail.",science,1,1602766713,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Highlights

• Use of a combination of vitamin D, magnesium, and vitamin B12 (DMB) in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was studied.

• Fewer patients ≥50 y of age with COVID-19 on DMB suffered clinical deterioration.

• Further studies are warranted to ascertain the full benefit of DMB in patients with COVID-19.

Abstract

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine clinical outcomes of older patients with coronavirus (COVID-19) who received a combination of vitamin D, magnesium, and vitamin B12 (DMB) compared with those who did not. We hypothesized that fewer patients administered this combination would require oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or a combination of both than those who did not.

Methods

This was a cohort observational study of all consecutive hospitalized patients ≥50 y of age with COVID-19 in a tertiary academic hospital. Before April 6, 2020, no patients received the (DMB) combination. After this date, patients were administered 1000 IU/d oral vitamin D3, 150 mg/d oral magnesium, and 500 mcg/d oral vitamin B12 upon admission if they did not require oxygen therapy. Primary outcome was deterioration leading to any form of oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both.

Results

Between January 15 and April 15, 2020, we identified 43 consecutive patients ≥50 y of age with COVID-19. Seventeen patients received DMB before onset of primary outcome and 26 patients did not. Baseline demographic characteristics between the two groups were significantly different by age. In univariate analysis, age and hypertension had a significant influence on outcome. After adjusting for age or hypertension separately in a multivariate analysis, the intervention group retained protective significance. Fewer treated patients than controls required initiation of oxygen therapy during hospitalization (17.6 vs 61.5%, P = 0.006). DMB exposure was associated with odds ratios of 0.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03–0.59) and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.04–0.93) for oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both on univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively.

Conclusions

A vitamin D / magnesium / vitamin B12 combination in older COVID-19 patients was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of patients with clinical deterioration requiring oxygen support, intensive care support, or both. This study supports further larger randomized controlled trials to ascertain the full benefit of this combination in ameliorating the severity of COVID-19.",science,1,1602756555,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

Sudden onset sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is frequently seen by otolaryngologists. The exact pathophysiology of the disease is still unknown, with the most likely causative factor being following a viral infection. Immediate steroids are the best treatment to improve prognosis. Despite a plethora of papers in the literature describing SSNHL, there are only a few reported cases of hearing loss following COVID-19, none of which have been reported in the UK. This paper presents the first UK case of SSNHL following COVID-19. Physical examination and imaging excluded any other cause of hearing loss. A literature review showed that four other cases have been previously described. Hearing loss can be a significant cause of morbidity and can easily be missed in the intensive care setting. Being aware and screening for SSNHL following COVID-19 enables an early course of steroids, which offers the best chance of recovering hearing.",science,1,1602671711,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Summary

Background

In early 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, New Zealand implemented graduated, risk-informed national COVID-19 suppression measures aimed at disease elimination. We investigated their impacts on the epidemiology of the first wave of COVID-19 in the country and response performance measures.

Methods

We did a descriptive epidemiological study of all laboratory-confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 and all patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in New Zealand from Feb 2 to May 13, 2020, after which time community transmission ceased. We extracted data from the national notifiable diseases database and the national SARS-CoV-2 test results repository. Demographic features and disease outcomes, transmission patterns (source of infection, outbreaks, household transmission), time-to-event intervals, and testing coverage were described over five phases of the response, capturing different levels of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Risk factors for severe outcomes (hospitalisation or death) were examined with multivariable logistic regression and time-to-event intervals were analysed by fitting parametric distributions using maximum likelihood estimation.

Findings

1503 cases were detected over the study period, including 95 (6·3%) hospital admissions and 22 (1·5%) COVID-19 deaths. The estimated case infection rate per million people per day peaked at 8·5 (95% CI 7·6–9·4) during the 10-day period of rapid response escalation, declining to 3·2 (2·8–3·7) in the start of lockdown and progressively thereafter. 1034 (69%) cases were imported or import related, tending to be younger adults, of European ethnicity, and of higher socioeconomic status. 702 (47%) cases were linked to 34 outbreaks. Severe outcomes were associated with locally acquired infection (crude odds ratio [OR] 2·32 [95% CI 1·40–3·82] compared with imported), older age (adjusted OR ranging from 2·72 [1·40–5·30] for 50–64 year olds to 8·25 [2·59–26·31] for people aged ≥80 years compared with 20–34 year olds), aged residential care residency (adjusted OR 3·86 [1·59–9·35]), and Pacific peoples (adjusted OR 2·76 [1·14–6·68]) and Asian (2·15 [1·10–4·20]) ethnicities relative to European or other. Times from illness onset to notification and isolation progressively decreased and testing increased over the study period, with few disparities and increasing coverage of females, Māori, Pacific peoples, and lower socioeconomic groups.

Interpretation

New Zealand's response resulted in low relative burden of disease, low levels of population disease disparities, and the initial achievement of COVID-19 elimination.",science,1,1602670313,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

and Methods: Charts of consecutive patients hospitalized at four Broward Health hospitals in Florida with confirmed COVID-19 between March 15 through May 11, 2020 treated with or without ivermectin were reviewed. Hospital ivermectin dosing guidelines were provided but treatment decisions were per treating physician’s discretion. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement, extubation rates for mechanically ventilated patients, and length of stay. Severe pulmonary involvement was defined as need for FiO2 ≥50%, noninvasive ventilation, or invasive ventilation at study entry. Logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to adjust for confounders.

Results

280 patients, 173 treated with ivermectin and 107 without ivermectin, were reviewed. Most patients in both groups also received hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin. Univariate analysis showed lower mortality in the ivermectin group (15.0% versus 25.2%, OR 0.52, CI 0.29-0.96, P=0.03). Mortality was also lower among ivermectin-treated patients with severe pulmonary involvement (38.8% vs 80.7%, OR 0.15, CI 0.05-0.47, p=0.001). There were no significant differences in extubation rates (36.1% vs 15.4%, OR 3.11 (0.88-11.00), p=0.07) or length of stay. After multivariate adjustment for confounders and mortality risks, the mortality difference remained significant (OR 0.27, CI 0.09-0.80, p=0.03). 196 patients were included in the propensity-matched cohort. Mortality was significantly lower in the ivermectin group (13.3% vs 24.5%, OR 0.47, CI 0.22-0.99, p&lt;0.05); an 11.2% (CI 0.38%-22.1%) absolute risk reduction, with a number needed to treat of 8.9 (CI 4.5-263).

Interpretation

Ivermectin treatment was associated with lower mortality during treatment of COVID-19, especially in patients with severe pulmonary involvement. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.",science,1,1602627629,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

PNAS first published October 12, 2020; 

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009609117

Significance

This study measures the impact of the COVID-19 lockdowns on workers’ economic hardship and mental health. In data representative of the active labor force, we document two interconnected layers of rapidly exacerbating inequalities. We find that occupational ranking is highly predictive of experiencing a range of instant economic hardships, such as workload decrease and income loss. Subsequent analyses indicate that such economic hardships lead to much higher prevalence of expressing adverse mental health, including feelings of depression and health anxiety. As the unprecedented societal shock of COVID-19 bears little comparison with prior economic recessions, we assert survey data of the labor force are paramount in understanding how workers’ mental health complaints came about.

Abstract

The COVID-19 economic crash is idiosyncratic because of its virtual standstill of economic activity. We therefore ask how individual labor market experiences are related to the development of mental health complaints in the spring of 2020. As clinical data collection was compromised during the lockdowns, standardized surveys of the European labor force provide an opportunity to observe mental health complaints as the crisis unfolded. Data are representative of active members of the labor force of six European nations that contained varying levels of COVID-19 burdens in terms of mortality and lockdown measures. We document a steep occupational prestige level gradient on the probability of facing economic hardship during the lockdowns—looming job loss, income loss, and workload decline—which evidently exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities. Analyses indicate a striking positive relationship between instantaneous economic hardships during the COVID-19 lockdown and expressing feelings of depression and health anxiety. Importantly, the magnitude of the association between such hardships and indicators of mental health deterioration is highly dependent on workers’ occupational standing, revealing a second layer of exacerbating inequality.",science,1,1602590915,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer substantially improves survival. However, over half of cases are diagnosed late due to the demand for colonoscopy—the ‘gold standard’ for screening—exceeding capacity. Colonoscopy is limited by the outdated design of conventional endoscopes, which are associated with high complexity of use, cost and pain. Magnetic endoscopes are a promising alternative and overcome the drawbacks of pain and cost, but they struggle to reach the translational stage as magnetic manipulation is complex and unintuitive. In this work, we use machine vision to develop intelligent and autonomous control of a magnetic endoscope, enabling non-expert users to effectively perform magnetic colonoscopy in vivo. We combine the use of robotics, computer vision and advanced control to offer an intuitive and effective endoscopic system. Moreover, we define the characteristics required to achieve autonomy in robotic endoscopy. The paradigm described here can be adopted in a variety of applications where navigation in unstructured environments is required, such as catheters, pancreatic endoscopy, bronchoscopy and gastroscopy. This work brings alternative endoscopic technologies closer to the translational stage, increasing the availability of early-stage cancer treatments.",science,1,1602583506,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Alyssa Bilinski, MSc1; Ezekiel J. Emanuel, MD, PhD2

JAMA. Published online October 12, 2020. 

doi:10.1001/jama.2020.20717

The US has experienced more deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than any other country and has one of the highest cumulative per capita death rates.1,2 An unanswered question is to what extent high US mortality was driven by the early surge of cases prior to improvements in prevention and patient management vs a poor longer-term response.3 We compared US COVID-19 deaths and excess all-cause mortality in 2020 (vs 2015-2019) to that of 18 countries with diverse COVID-19 responses.

Methods

We compared the US to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries with populations exceeding 5 million and greater than $25 000 per capita gross domestic product. For each country, we calculated the COVID-19 per capita mortality rate and grouped countries by mortality: (1) low (COVID-19 deaths, &lt;5/100 000), (2) moderate (5-25/100 000), and (3) high (&gt;25/100 000).1 We used Poisson regression for comparisons across countries.

We calculated the difference in COVID-19 deaths between each country and the US through September 19, 2020 (week 38) under 3 scenarios: if the US had a comparable per capita COVID-19 mortality rate to each country from the start of the pandemic (February 13) or if the US mortality rate became comparable to other countries beginning May 10 or June 7, to allow lag time for policy interventions.3 (See the Supplement for formulas.)

We also considered all-cause mortality per capita for countries with publicly available data through July 25, 2020 (week 30). This measure is robust to country-level differences in COVID-19 death coding and captures indirect pandemic effects. We estimated excess all-cause mortality (the difference between mean 2020 deaths and deaths in corresponding weeks of 2015-2019) for each country and the US, compared rates across countries using Poisson regression with country and week fixed effects (Supplement), and estimated the difference in excess all-cause mortality between each country and the US as described above. We used R software (version 4.0.2) for all analyses.

Results

On September 19, 2020, the US reported a total of 198 589 COVID-19 deaths (60.3/100 000), higher than countries with low and moderate COVID-19 mortality but comparable with high-mortality countries (Table 1). For instance, Australia (low mortality) had 3.3 deaths per 100 000 and Canada (moderate mortality) had 24.6 per 100 000. Conversely, Italy had 59.1 COVID-19 deaths per 100 000; Belgium had 86.8 per 100 000. If the US death rates were comparable to Australia, the US would have had 187 661 fewer COVID-19 deaths (94% of reported deaths), and if comparable with Canada, 117 622 fewer deaths (59%).

While the US had a lower COVID-19 mortality rate than high-mortality countries during the early spring, after May 10, all 6 high-mortality countries had fewer deaths per 100 000 than the US. For instance, between May 10 and September 19, 2020, Italy’s death rate was 9.1/100 000 while the US’s rate was 36.9/100 000. If the US had comparable death rates with most high-mortality countries beginning May 10, it would have had 44 210 to 104 177 fewer deaths (22%-52%) (Table 1). If the US had comparable death rates beginning June 7, it would have had 28% to 43% fewer reported deaths (as a percentage overall).

In the 14 countries with all-cause mortality data, the patterns found for COVID-19–specific deaths were similar for excess all-cause mortality (Table 2). In countries with moderate COVID-19 mortality, excess all-cause mortality remained negligible throughout the pandemic. In countries with high COVID-19 mortality, excess all-cause mortality reached as high as 102.1/100 000 in Spain, while in the US it was 71.6/100 000. However, since May 10 and June 7, excess all-cause mortality was higher in the US than in all high-mortality countries (Table 2).

Discussion

Compared with other countries, the US experienced high COVID-19–associated mortality and excess all-cause mortality into September 2020. After the first peak in early spring, US death rates from COVID-19 and from all causes remained higher than even countries with high COVID-19 mortality. This may have been a result of several factors, including weak public health infrastructure and a decentralized, inconsistent US response to the pandemic.4,5

Limitations of this analysis include differences in mortality risk: the US population is younger but has more comorbidities compared with the other countries.6 In addition, since late August death rates have increased in several countries, and how mortality will compare with the US throughout fall remains unknown.",science,2,1602536670,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

Objective To describe neuroimaging findings and to report the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with neurologic manifestations.

Methods In this retrospective multicenter study (11 hospitals), we included 64 patients with confirmed COVID-19 with neurologic manifestations who underwent a brain MRI.

Results The cohort included 43 men (67%) and 21 women (33%); their median age was 66 (range 20–92) years. Thirty-six (56%) brain MRIs were considered abnormal, possibly related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Ischemic strokes (27%), leptomeningeal enhancement (17%), and encephalitis (13%) were the most frequent neuroimaging findings. Confusion (53%) was the most common neurologic manifestation, followed by impaired consciousness (39%), presence of clinical signs of corticospinal tract involvement (31%), agitation (31%), and headache (16%). The profile of patients experiencing ischemic stroke was different from that of other patients with abnormal brain imaging: the former less frequently had acute respiratory distress syndrome (p = 0.006) and more frequently had corticospinal tract signs (p = 0.02). Patients with encephalitis were younger (p = 0.007), whereas agitation was more frequent for patients with leptomeningeal enhancement (p = 0.009).

Conclusions Patients with COVID-19 may develop a wide range of neurologic symptoms, which can be associated with severe and fatal complications such as ischemic stroke or encephalitis. In terms of meningoencephalitis involvement, even if a direct effect of the virus cannot be excluded, the pathophysiology seems to involve an immune or inflammatory process given the presence of signs of inflammation in both CSF and neuroimaging but the lack of virus in CSF.",science,1,1602498096,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Persistence and decay of human antibody responses to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in COVID-19 patients

Science Immunology  08 Oct 2020:
Vol. 5, Issue 52, eabe0367

DOI: 10.1126/sciimmunol.abe0367

Abstract

We measured plasma and/or serum antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in 343 North American patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (of which 93% required hospitalization) up to 122 days after symptom onset and compared them to responses in 1548 individuals whose blood samples were obtained prior to the pandemic. After setting seropositivity thresholds for perfect specificity (100%), we estimated sensitivities of 95% for IgG, 90% for IgA, and 81% for IgM for detecting infected individuals between 15 and 28 days after symptom onset. While the median time to seroconversion was nearly 12 days across all three isotypes tested, IgA and IgM antibodies against RBD were short-lived with median times to seroreversion of 71 and 49 days after symptom onset. In contrast, anti-RBD IgG responses decayed slowly through 90 days with only 3 seropositive individuals seroreverting within this time period. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were strongly correlated with anti-S neutralizing antibody titers, which demonstrated little to no decrease over 75 days since symptom onset. We observed no cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted antibodies with other widely circulating coronaviruses (HKU1, 229 E, OC43, NL63). These data suggest that RBD-targeted antibodies are excellent markers of previous and recent infection, that differential isotype measurements can help distinguish between recent and older infections, and that IgG responses persist over the first few months after infection and are highly correlated with neutralizing antibodies.",science,1,1602497153,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

The effect of temperature on persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on common surfaces

Riddell, S., Goldie, S., Hill, A. et al.

Virology Journal volume 17, Article number: 145 (2020) 

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01418-7

Abstract

Background

The rate at which COVID-19 has spread throughout the globe has been alarming. While the role of fomite transmission is not yet fully understood, precise data on the environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 is required to determine the risks of fomite transmission from contaminated surfaces.

Methods

This study measured the survival rates of infectious SARS-CoV-2, suspended in a standard ASTM E2197 matrix, on several common surface types. All experiments were carried out in the dark, to negate any effects of UV light. Inoculated surfaces were incubated at 20 °C, 30 °C and 40 °C and sampled at various time points.

Results

Survival rates of SARS-CoV-2 were determined at different temperatures and D-values, Z-values and half-life were calculated. We obtained half lives of between 1.7 and 2.7 days at 20 °C, reducing to a few hours when temperature was elevated to 40 °C. With initial viral loads broadly equivalent to the highest titres excreted by infectious patients, viable virus was isolated for up to 28 days at 20 °C from common surfaces such as glass, stainless steel and both paper and polymer banknotes. Conversely, infectious virus survived less than 24 h at 40 °C on some surfaces.

Conclusion

These findings demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for significantly longer time periods than generally considered possible. These results could be used to inform improved risk mitigation procedures to prevent the fomite spread of COVID-19.",science,1,1602452806,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Highlights

• Combined static magnetic and electric fields (sBE) enhance insulin sensitivity

• sBE is not associated with adverse effects

• sBE triggers a systemic redox response to modulate insulin sensitivity

• Scavenging mitochondrial superoxide in the liver abolishes the effects of sBE

Summary

Aberrant redox signaling underlies the pathophysiology of many chronic metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methodologies aimed at rebalancing systemic redox homeostasis have had limited success. A noninvasive, sustained approach would enable the long-term control of redox signaling for the treatment of T2D. We report that static magnetic and electric fields (sBE) noninvasively modulate the systemic GSH-to-GSSG redox couple to promote a healthier systemic redox environment that is reducing. Strikingly, when applied to mouse models of T2D, sBE rapidly ameliorates insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in as few as 3 days with no observed adverse effects. Scavenging paramagnetic byproducts of oxygen metabolism with SOD2 in hepatic mitochondria fully abolishes these insulin sensitizing effects, demonstrating that mitochondrial superoxide mediates induction of these therapeutic changes. Our findings introduce a remarkable redox-modulating phenomenon that exploits endogenous electromagneto-receptive mechanisms for the noninvasive treatment of T2D, and potentially other redox-related diseases.",science,1,1602362486,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Transmission Dynamics by Age Group in COVID-19 Hotspot Counties — United States, April–September 2020. 

MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 9 October 2020. 

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6941e1

CDC works with other federal agencies to identify counties with increasing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence (hotspots) and offers support to state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1). Understanding whether increasing incidence in hotspot counties is predominantly occurring in specific age groups is important for identifying opportunities to prevent or reduce transmission. The percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results (percent positivity) is an important indicator of community transmission.* CDC analyzed temporal trends in percent positivity by age group in COVID-19 hotspot counties before and after their identification as hotspots. Among 767 hotspot counties identified during June and July 2020, early increases in the percent positivity among persons aged ≤24 years were followed by several weeks of increasing percent positivity in persons aged ≥25 years. Addressing transmission among young adults is an urgent public health priority.

The 767 hotspot counties detected during June 1–July 31 represented 24% of all U.S. counties and 63% of the U.S. population. Percent positivity among persons aged 0–17 and 18–24 years began increasing 31 days before hotspot identification.

In hotspot counties, particularly those in the South and West, percent positivity increased earliest in younger persons, followed by several weeks of increasing percent positivity among older age groups. An increase in the percentage of positive test results in older age groups is likely to result in more hospitalizations, severe illnesses, and deaths.¶ These findings corroborate regional patterns in the southern United States, where increased percent positivity among adults aged 20–39 years preceded increases among those aged ≥60 years (2); provide evidence that among young adults, those aged 18–24 years demonstrate the earliest increases in percent positivity; and underscore the importance of reducing transmission from younger populations to those at highest risk for severe illness or death. There is an urgent need to address transmission among young adult populations, especially given recent increases in COVID-19 incidence among young adults (3). These data also demonstrate the urgency of health care preparedness in hotspot counties,** which are likely to experience increases in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations among older populations in the weeks after meeting hotspot criteria.",science,1,1602329485,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3588 (Published 07 October 2020)

Abstract

Objective To replicate and analyse the information available to UK policymakers when the lockdown decision was taken in March 2020 in the United Kingdom.

Design Independent calculations using the CovidSim code, which implements Imperial College London’s individual based model, with data available in March 2020 applied to the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) epidemic.

Setting Simulations considering the spread of covid-19 in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Population About 70 million simulated people matched as closely as possible to actual UK demographics, geography, and social behaviours.

Main outcome measures Replication of summary data on the covid-19 epidemic reported to the UK government Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), and a detailed study of unpublished results, especially the effect of school closures.

Results The CovidSim model would have produced a good forecast of the subsequent data if initialised with a reproduction number of about 3.5 for covid-19. The model predicted that school closures and isolation of younger people would increase the total number of deaths, albeit postponed to a second and subsequent waves. The findings of this study suggest that prompt interventions were shown to be highly effective at reducing peak demand for intensive care unit (ICU) beds but also prolong the epidemic, in some cases resulting in more deaths long term. This happens because covid-19 related mortality is highly skewed towards older age groups. In the absence of an effective vaccination programme, none of the proposed mitigation strategies in the UK would reduce the predicted total number of deaths below 200 000.

Conclusions It was predicted in March 2020 that in response to covid-19 a broad lockdown, as opposed to a focus on shielding the most vulnerable members of society, would reduce immediate demand for ICU beds at the cost of more deaths long term. The optimal strategy for saving lives in a covid-19 epidemic is different from that anticipated for an influenza epidemic with a different mortality age profile.",science,1,1602326178,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to extensive morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Clinical features that drive SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in humans include inflammation and thrombosis, but the mechanistic details underlying these processes remain to be determined. In this study, we demonstrate endothelial disruption and vascular thrombosis in histopathologic sections of lungs from both humans and rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2. To define key molecular pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in macaques, we performed transcriptomic analyses of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood and proteomic analyses of serum. We observed macrophage infiltrates in lung and upregulation of macrophage, complement, platelet activation, thrombosis, and proinflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, MX1, IL-6, IL-1, IL-8, TNFα, and NF-κB. These results suggest a model in which critical interactions between inflammatory and thrombosis pathways lead to SARS-CoV-2 induced vascular disease. Our findings suggest potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19.",science,1,1602325470,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Among 767 hotspot counties identified during June and July 2020, early increases in the percent positivity among persons aged ≤24 years were followed by several weeks of increasing percent positivity in persons aged ≥25 years. Addressing transmission among young adults is an urgent public health priority.

In hotspot counties, particularly those in the South and West, percent positivity increased earliest in younger persons, followed by several weeks of increasing percent positivity among older age groups.",science,1,1602281599,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

The RECOVERY Collaborative Group*

NEJM, October 8, 2020

DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2022926

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been proposed as treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) on the basis of in vitro activity and data from uncontrolled studies and small, randomized trials.

METHODS

In this randomized, controlled, open-label platform trial comparing a range of possible treatments with usual care in patients hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned 1561 patients to receive hydroxychloroquine and 3155 to receive usual care. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.

RESULTS

The enrollment of patients in the hydroxychloroquine group was closed on June 5, 2020, after an interim analysis determined that there was a lack of efficacy. Death within 28 days occurred in 421 patients (27.0%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and in 790 (25.0%) in the usual-care group (rate ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 to 1.23; P=0.15). Consistent results were seen in all prespecified subgroups of patients. The results suggest that patients in the hydroxychloroquine group were less likely to be discharged from the hospital alive within 28 days than those in the usual-care group (59.6% vs. 62.9%; rate ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.98). Among the patients who were not undergoing mechanical ventilation at baseline, those in the hydroxychloroquine group had a higher frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (30.7% vs. 26.9%; risk ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.27). There was a small numerical excess of cardiac deaths (0.4 percentage points) but no difference in the incidence of new major cardiac arrhythmia among the patients who received hydroxychloroquine.

CONCLUSIONS

Among patients hospitalized with Covid-19, those who received hydroxychloroquine did not have a lower incidence of death at 28 days than those who received usual care.",science,1,1602280016,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

NEJM October 8, 2020

DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2007764

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), no antiviral agents have yet been shown to be efficacious.

METHODS

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.

RESULTS

A total of 1062 patients underwent randomization (with 541 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo). Those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 11), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 18) among those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.49; P&lt;0.001, by a log-rank test). In an analysis that used a proportional-odds model with an eight-category ordinal scale, the patients who received remdesivir were found to be more likely than those who received placebo to have clinical improvement at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9, after adjustment for actual disease severity). The Kaplan–Meier estimates of mortality were 6.7% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo by day 15 and 11.4% with remdesivir and 15.2% with placebo by day 29 (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03). Serious adverse events were reported in 131 of the 532 patients who received remdesivir (24.6%) and in 163 of the 516 patients who received placebo (31.6%).

CONCLUSIONS

Our data show that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.",science,1,1602279707,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

BMJ 2020; 371 

doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3588 (Published 07 October 2020)

Abstract

Objective To replicate and analyse the information available to UK policymakers when the lockdown decision was taken in March 2020 in the United Kingdom.

Design Independent calculations using the CovidSim code, which implements Imperial College London’s individual based model, with data available in March 2020 applied to the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) epidemic.

Setting Simulations considering the spread of covid-19 in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Population About 70 million simulated people matched as closely as possible to actual UK demographics, geography, and social behaviours.

Main outcome measures Replication of summary data on the covid-19 epidemic reported to the UK government Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), and a detailed study of unpublished results, especially the effect of school closures.

Results The CovidSim model would have produced a good forecast of the subsequent data if initialised with a reproduction number of about 3.5 for covid-19. The model predicted that school closures and isolation of younger people would increase the total number of deaths, albeit postponed to a second and subsequent waves. The findings of this study suggest that prompt interventions were shown to be highly effective at reducing peak demand for intensive care unit (ICU) beds but also prolong the epidemic, in some cases resulting in more deaths long term. This happens because covid-19 related mortality is highly skewed towards older age groups. In the absence of an effective vaccination programme, none of the proposed mitigation strategies in the UK would reduce the predicted total number of deaths below 200 000.

Conclusions It was predicted in March 2020 that in response to covid-19 a broad lockdown, as opposed to a focus on shielding the most vulnerable members of society, would reduce immediate demand for ICU beds at the cost of more deaths long term. The optimal strategy for saving lives in a covid-19 epidemic is different from that anticipated for an influenza epidemic with a different mortality age profile.",science,1,1602238853,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020)

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-06277-0

Abstract

Background

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected over 5 million United States (US) residents resulting in more than 180,000 deaths by August 2020. To mitigate transmission, most states ordered shelter-in-place orders in March and reopening strategies varied.

Objective

To estimate excess COVID-19 cases and deaths after reopening compared with trends prior to reopening for two groups of states: (1) states with an evidence-based reopening strategy, defined as reopening indoor dining after implementing a statewide mask mandate, and (2) states reopening indoor dining rooms before implementing a statewide mask mandate.

Design

Interrupted time series quasi-experimental study design applied to publicly available secondary data.

Participants

Fifty United States and the District of Columbia.

Interventions

Reopening indoor dining rooms before or after implementing a statewide mask mandate.

Main Measures

Outcomes included daily cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths for each state.

Key Results

On average, the number of excess cases per 100,000 residents in states reopening without masks is ten times the number in states reopening with masks after 8 weeks (643.1 cases; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 406.9, 879.2 and 62.9 cases; CI = 12.6, 113.1, respectively). Excess cases after 6 weeks could have been reduced by 90% from 576,371 to 63,062 and excess deaths reduced by 80% from 22,851 to 4858 had states implemented mask mandates prior to reopening. Over 50,000 excess deaths were prevented within 6 weeks in 13 states that implemented mask mandates prior to reopening.

Conclusions

Additional mitigation measures such as mask use counteract the potential growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths due to reopening businesses. This study contributes to the growing evidence that mask usage is essential for mitigating community transmission of COVID-19. States should delay further reopening until mask mandates are fully implemented, and enforcement by local businesses will be critical for preventing potential future closures.",science,16,1602193765,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

Objectives

The Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor baricitinib may block viral entry into pneumocytes and prevent cytokine storm in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. We aimed to assess whether baricitinib improved pulmonary function in patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids for moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

Methods

This observational study enrolled patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &lt;200 mmHg] who received lopinavir/ritonavir and HCQ plus either corticosteroids (CS group, n = 50) or corticosteroids and baricitinib (BCT-CS group, n = 62). The primary end point was the change in oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2)/FiO2 from hospitalization to discharge. Secondary end points included the proportion of patients requiring supplemental oxygen at discharge and 1 month later. Statistics were adjusted by the inverse propensity score weighting (IPSW).

Results

A greater improvement in SpO2/FiO2 from hospitalization to discharge was observed in the BCT-CS vs CS group (mean differences adjusted for IPSW, 49; 95% CI: 22, 77; P &lt; 0.001). A higher proportion of patients required supplemental oxygen both at discharge (62.0% vs 25.8%; reduction of the risk by 82%, OR adjusted for IPSW, 0.18; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.43; P &lt; 0.001) and 1 month later (28.0% vs 12.9%, reduction of the risk by 69%, OR adjusted for IPSW, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.86; P = 0.024) in the CS vs BCT-CS group.

Conclusions

In patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia a combination of baricitinib with corticosteroids was associated with greater improvement in pulmonary function when compared with corticosteroids alone.",science,1,1602155015,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

Background:

Few treatments exist for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Purpose:

To evaluate the effectiveness and harms of remdesivir for COVID-19.

Data Sources:

Several databases, tables of contents of journals, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration and company websites were searched from 1 January through 31 August 2020.

Study Selection:

English-language, randomized trials of remdesivir treatments for adults with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. New evidence will be incorporated using living review methods.

Data Extraction:

Single-reviewer abstraction and risk-of-bias assessment verified by a second reviewer; GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods used for certainty-of-evidence assessments.

Data Synthesis:

Four randomized trials were included. In adults with severe COVID-19, remdesivir compared with placebo probably improves recovery by a large amount (absolute risk difference [ARD] range, 7% to 10%) and may result in a small reduction in mortality (ARD range, -4% to 1%) and a shorter time to recovery or clinical improvement. Remdesivir may have little to no effect on hospital length of stay. Remdesivir probably reduces serious adverse events by a moderate amount (ARD range, −6% to −8%). Compared with a 10-day remdesivir course, a 5-day course may reduce mortality, increase recovery or clinical improvement by small to moderate amounts, reduce time to recovery, and reduce serious adverse events among hospitalized patients not requiring mechanical ventilation. Recovery due to remdesivir may not vary by age, sex, symptom duration, or disease severity.

Limitations:

Low-certainty evidence with few published trials, including 1 preliminary report and 2 open-label trials. Trials excluded pregnant women and adults with severe kidney or liver disease.

Conclusion:

In hospitalized adults with COVID-19, remdesivir probably improves recovery and reduces serious adverse events and may reduce mortality and time to clinical improvement. For adults not receiving mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a 5-day course of remdesivir may provide similar benefits to and fewer harms than a 10-day course.",science,1,1602151284,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Summary

What is already known about this topic?

Community mitigation measures can help slow the spread of COVID-19.

What is added by this report?

The number of COVID-19 cases in Arizona stabilized and then decreased after sustained implementation and enforcement of statewide and locally enhanced mitigation measures, beginning approximately 2 weeks after implementation and enforcement of mask mandates and enhanced sanitations practices began on June 17; further decreases were observed during July 13–August 7, after statewide limitations and closures of certain services and businesses.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Widespread implementation and enforcement of sustained community mitigation measures, including mask wearing, informed by state and local officials’ continual data monitoring and collaboration can help prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the numbers of COVID-19 cases.",science,1,1602064255,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Preexisting immune response to SARS-CoV-2
Robust T cell responses to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus occur in most individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several studies have reported that some people who have not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 have preexisting reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The immunological mechanisms underlying this preexisting reactivity are not clear, but previous exposure to widely circulating common cold coronaviruses might be involved. Mateus et al. found that the preexisting reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 comes from memory T cells and that cross-reactive T cells can specifically recognize a SARS-CoV-2 epitope as well as the homologous epitope from a common cold coronavirus. These findings underline the importance of determining the impacts of preexisting immune memory in COVID-19 disease severity.",science,1,1602027900,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

Background

Weeks after issuing social distancing orders to suppress severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and reduce growth in cases of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), all U.S. states and the District of Columbia partially or fully relaxed these measures.

Methods

We identified all statewide social distancing measures that were implemented and/or relaxed in the U.S. between March 10-July 15, 2020, triangulating data from state government and third-party sources. Using segmented linear regression, we estimated the extent to which relaxation of social distancing affected epidemic control, as indicated by the time-varying, state-specific effective reproduction number (Rt).

Results

In the eight weeks prior to relaxation, mean Rt declined by 0.012 units per day (95% CI, -0.013 to -0.012), and 46/51 jurisdictions achieved Rt &lt; 1.0 by the date of relaxation. After relaxation of social distancing, Rt reversed course and began increasing by 0.007 units per day (95% CI, 0.006-0.007), reaching a mean Rt of 1.16 eight weeks later, with only 9/51 jurisdictions maintaining Rt &lt;1.0. Parallel models showed similar reversals in the growth of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Indicators often used to motivate relaxation at the time of relaxation (e.g. test positivity rate &lt;5%) predicted greater post-relaxation epidemic growth.

Conclusions

We detected an immediate and significant reversal in SARS-CoV-2 epidemic suppression after relaxation of social distancing measures across the U.S. Premature relaxation of social distancing measures undermined the country’s ability to control the disease burden associated with COVID-19.",science,1,1601980632,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Summary

Background

Prominent clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include CNS manifestations. However, it is unclear whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, gains access to the CNS and whether it causes neuropathological changes. We investigated the brain tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 for glial responses, inflammatory changes, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS.

Methods

In this post-mortem case series, we investigated the neuropathological features in the brains of patients who died between March 13 and April 24, 2020, in Hamburg, Germany. Inclusion criteria comprised a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and availability of adequate samples. We did a neuropathological workup including histological staining and immunohistochemical staining for activated astrocytes, activated microglia, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the olfactory bulb, basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum. Additionally, we investigated the presence and localisation of SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR and by immunohistochemistry in selected patients and brain regions.

Findings

43 patients were included in our study. Patients died in hospitals, nursing homes, or at home, and were aged between 51 years and 94 years (median 76 years [IQR 70–86]). We detected fresh territorial ischaemic lesions in six (14%) patients. 37 (86%) patients had astrogliosis in all assessed regions. Activation of microglia and infiltration by cytotoxic T lymphocytes was most pronounced in the brainstem and cerebellum, and meningeal cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration was seen in 34 (79%) patients. SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in the brains of 21 (53%) of 40 examined patients, with SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins found in cranial nerves originating from the lower brainstem and in isolated cells of the brainstem. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS was not associated with the severity of neuropathological changes.

Interpretation

In general, neuropathological changes in patients with COVID-19 seem to be mild, with pronounced neuroinflammatory changes in the brainstem being the most common finding. There was no evidence for CNS damage directly caused by SARS-CoV-2. The generalisability of these findings needs to be validated in future studies as the number of cases and availability of clinical data were low and no age-matched and sex-matched controls were included.",science,1,1601980410,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

There is increasing evidence that children and adolescents can efficiently transmit SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1–3). During July–August 2020, four state health departments and CDC investigated a COVID-19 outbreak that occurred during a 3-week family gathering of five households in which an adolescent aged 13 years was the index and suspected primary patient; 11 subsequent cases occurred.

This outbreak highlights several important issues. First, children and adolescents can serve as the source for COVID-19 outbreaks within families, even when their symptoms are mild (2). Better understanding of transmission by children and adolescents in different settings is needed to refine public health guidance.",science,2,1601936189,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

Background

The stability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on human skin remains unknown, considering the hazards of viral exposure to humans. We generated a model that allows the safe reproduction of clinical studies on the application of pathogens to human skin and elucidated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on the human skin.

Methods

We evaluated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV), mixed with culture medium or upper respiratory mucus, on human skin surfaces and the dermal disinfection effectiveness of 80% (w/w) ethanol against SARS-CoV-2 and IAV.

Results

SARS-CoV-2 and IAV were inactivated more rapidly on skin surfaces than on other surfaces (stainless steel/glass/plastic); the survival time was significantly longer for SARS-CoV-2 than for IAV [9.04 h (95% confidence interval: 7.96–10.2 h) vs. 1.82 h (1.65–2.00 h)]. IAV on other surfaces was inactivated faster in mucus versus medium conditions, while SARS-CoV-2 showed similar stability in the mucus and medium; the survival time was significantly longer for SARS-CoV-2 than for IAV [11.09 h (10.22–12.00 h) vs. 1.69 h (1.57–1.81 h)]. Moreover, both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV in the mucus/medium on human skin were completely inactivated within 15 s by ethanol treatment.

Conclusions

The 9-h survival of SARS-CoV-2 on human skin may increase the risk of contact transmission in comparison with IAV, thus accelerating the pandemic. Proper hand hygiene is important to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections.",science,1,1601893053,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18174-5

Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through an interaction between the spike glycoprotein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. Ty1 binds the RBD with high affinity, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 Å resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the ‘up’ and ‘down’ conformations, sterically hindering RBD-ACE2 binding. While fusion to an Fc domain renders Ty1 extremely potent, Ty1 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus as a 12.8 kDa nanobody, which can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19.",science,12,1601850670,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Abstract

Public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have potential to impact transmission of other respiratory viruses. We found 98.0% and 99.4% reductions in RSV and influenza detections respectively in Western Australian children through winter 2020; despite reopening of schools. Border closures have likely been important in limiting introductions from abroad.",science,1,1601805303,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

A woman in her 40s presented with unilateral rhinorrhea, metallic taste, headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia. The patient had recently completed nasal COVID-19 testing for an elective hernia repair. Shortly after, she developed unilateral rhinorrhea, headache, and vomiting. The patient’s medical history was notable for idiopathic intracranial hypertension and removal of nasal polyps over 20 years before presentation. Physical examination revealed clear rhinorrhea from the right side. Flexible nasopharyngoscopy revealed a mass in the right anterior middle meatus, but did not identify the source of the fluid. The nasal drainage tested positive for β2-transferrin. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a 1.8-cm encephalocele extending through the right ethmoid fovea into the middle meatus and a right sphenoid wing pseudomeningocele. Comparing these images to findings on CT performed in 2017 revealed that the encephalocele dated at least to that time (Figure 1). The 2017 CT diagnosis was paranasal sinus disease but not an encephalocele. The patient was admitted to the hospital for endoscopic surgical repair. At the beginning of the procedure, intrathecal fluorescein was infused through a lumbar drain. An encephalocele was identified in the right anterior ethmoid cavity (Figure 2). After reduction of the encephalocele, a skull base defect in the fovea ethmoidalis was repaired with a combination of acellular human dermal matrix and a poly(D,L-lactic) acid. The patient was admitted postoperatively for neurological monitoring and lumbar drain management.",science,4,1601596848,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

Discussion

There are limited data on the characteristics and outcomes of cardiac arrest in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the US. In our study of 54 patients with COVID-19, there was a 100% mortality rate following CPR. The initial rhythm was nonshockable for 52 patients (96.3%), with pulseless electrical activity being the most common (44 [81.5%]). Despite 29 patients (53.7%) achieving ROSC, none survived to discharge.",science,1,1601561719,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b1 elicits human antibody and TH1 T-cell responses.

Abstract

An effective vaccine is needed to halt the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Recently, we reported safety, tolerability and antibody response data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase 1/2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine trial with BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein1. Here we present antibody and T-cell responses after BNT162b1 vaccination from a second, non-randomized open-label phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults, 18-55 years of age. Two doses of 1 to 50 µg of BNT162b1 elicited robust CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses and strong antibody responses, with RBD-binding IgG concentrations clearly above those in a COVID-19 human convalescent sample (HCS) panel. Day 43 SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralising geometric mean titers were 0.7-fold (1 µg) to 3.5-fold (50 µg) those of the HCS panel. Immune sera broadly neutralised pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 spike variants. Most participants had T helper type 1 (TH1) skewed T cell immune responses with RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell expansion. Interferon (IFN)γ was produced by a high fraction of RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The robust RBD-specific antibody, T-cell and favourable cytokine responses induced by the BNT162b1 mRNA vaccine suggest multiple beneficial mechanisms with potential to protect against COVID-19.",science,1,1601555109,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides define heterologous and COVID-19-induced T cell recognition.

Published: 30 September 2020

DOI:  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-020-00808-x

Abstract

T cell immunity is central for the control of viral infections. To characterize T cell immunity, but also for the development of vaccines, identification of exact viral T cell epitopes is fundamental. Here we identify and characterize multiple dominant and subdominant SARS-CoV-2 HLA class I and HLA-DR peptides as potential T cell epitopes in COVID-19 convalescent and unexposed individuals. SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides enabled detection of post-infectious T cell immunity, even in seronegative convalescent individuals. Cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 peptides revealed pre-existing T cell responses in 81% of unexposed individuals and validated similarity with common cold coronaviruses, providing a functional basis for heterologous immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses was associated with mild symptoms of COVID-19, providing evidence that immunity requires recognition of multiple epitopes. Together, the proposed SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes enable identification of heterologous and post-infectious T cell immunity and facilitate development of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic measures for COVID-19.",science,1,1601554886,MD-PhD-MBA | Clinical Professor/Medicine

After he had finally brought all the required paperwork today, we were due back in November. As we were leaving I tried to come to an agreement while we were walking to the car. 

We started fighting outside, I was saying if he could just give me a reasonable number for maintenance we could just sign the paperwork and be done with this. Coming to court, dropping everything is horrid.

He started arguing that my husband and I lead an expensive life and he's not willing to support our lifestyle. Making comments like 'Our son wants to eat vegetables and now I have to go out of my way to buy this shit when he's there' (I'm vegetarian).  

My ex threaten that he would get our son to live with him from now on, and he would screw me over by asking for maintenance. 

As he walked away I shouted at him in pure frustration something like 'Would you please just listen to me and be reasonable'.  The judge was on his way to the bathroom when he stepped in the middle of our argument.

From your post it seems he's tagging you in FB posts which means you're not far from his mind. I wouldn't stress myself about it. If you need a response from him, perhaps communicate that if it's urgent you'll call? Once someone with ADHD gets into that flow state, where they hyper-focus it's very difficult for them to snap out of it. Their brains work very differently. 

Also social media is built for people to become addicted to scrolling, especially when we're all socially distancing.

I'd suggest reading about love languages. Perhaps his love language is being present with you in the moments you're together. Perhaps your love language is communicating. Learn each other's way of loving and speak openly about it.

Then one night he walked into the bathroom to find me holding his jacket against my face. I thought he was asleep and had forgotten to lock the door.

gaf47cy,ZDTreefur,"&gt; Where do you think ethics come from if not morals?

They can come from many sources. An office's code of conduct can have many ethical guidelines derived from societal morality, but often it's simply what's best for the company. A religion can have ethical guidelines (like not eating meat), but this can be wholly divorced from societal morality, and instead chosen because somebody thought he had a vision from god tell him what to do.

&gt; None of these things are objective at the end of the day because it's all social constructs.

Well that doesn't make any sense. A social construct doesn't stop morality from still being an objective standard, in fact it reinforces it. If society has chosen a set of moral laws, than people are beholden to those laws regardless of their own desires. That's an objective standard. Like rules for a board game. it doesn't matter if one player *wants* to move their pawn 5 paces diagonally, the objective rules for chess say it's not allowed. Even if those rules were decided by nothing except a social construct.

I think you are confusing objective with universal. There is definitely no reason to believe morality is a universal standard. But it's obviously an objective standard we use to govern our actions.",worldnews,1,1603917485,

Assisted suicide is also a concept that defies your attempt at claiming showing something compassion and killing it are a contradiction. In fact, it can easily be argued you are being *less* humane by allowing an animal to suffer instead of putting it down.

Far more of a necessity than you want to admit. Not that it even matters. Necessity or not, it's a choice we make so you need to defend why we should stop simply because it's not a necessity. 

But it's also far more of a necessity than you think. On an individual level, vegans can pick from the entire world's stock of different diverse foods to carefully craft a diet that can sustain them. But populations need an omnivorous diet to cater to the all sorts of people with different needs and interests. Not everybody can do a vegan diet, and even in the vegan community we see *far* too many people become malnourished and drop out, even though they thought they were doing it right. It's a problem vegans want to pretend doesn't exist.

What does that even mean? Are you also against pets, are you saying? Guard animals? Drug dogs? Farm labor animals? The need is our desire. There's no reason to not do so. You still need to make an actual argument for why we should stop.

Once I was in a Dunkin Donuts and my card was declined for absolutely no reason. The manager just sent me and the toddler on our way with our food. When I went back the next day to pay she wouldn’t let me. 

When I was 9 months pregnant something got stuck under my car on the highway. I pulled off and into a gas station, but I was so super round I couldn’t reach under my car. 4-5 people that were in the gas station came over and told me to move and they sorted it out and sent me on my way. 

When my dad decided to go off life support we spent 4 days at the hospital. My kids were with me, they were 9 &amp; 15 at the time, we were just going to visit for the weekend and had no idea this was coming. Every single person we encountered was so kind. But there was one janitor who watched my kids all weekend. They were set up in the back of a waiting room that had pull out couches. He moved a tv, made sure they had blankets and pillows, kept an eye on them, left snacks for them. Just so above and beyond and kind. One day my daughter and I were walking down the hall and he asked if he could pray with us. We aren’t a praying people, but he held our hands and prayed over us with such sincerity. He asked for a peaceful passing for my dad and strength for my kids to see him through to the end. Him using his faith to ask for help for us meant so much to me.",AskWomen,1,1603727023,

A lot of parents subscribe to the whole “let kids be kids” idea and think it means not giving them responsibility. The problem with that is if they don’t start out with small responsibilities and move on to bigger ones, then when it’s time to be responsible for their own shit they have no idea what to do.

gaeulin,recluseMeteor,"Pokémon creatures and character names are quite interesting examples.

The localisation “tradition” is that even people names are translated because they have an intention behind.

For example, in Pokémon Black and White, a gym leader is named “Kamitsure” (カミツレ), meaning “chamomile” and reminiscent of “kaminari” (雷, meaning “thunder”, since she uses electric-type Pokémon). The English localisation chose to name this character “Elesa”, reminiscent of “electric” and “Tesla”. The Spanish localisation preferred to keep the “chamomille” reference instead and named her “Camila” (a quite common Spanish name), similar to “camomila” (Spanish for “chamomile”).",TranslationStudies,2,1603912945,

gaeqyth,recluseMeteor,"I think it greatly depends on the topic and intent.

If this is literary translation and the meaning of someone's name will play a role in the story or  will be referenced, it will make a lot of sense to translate it. For example, Voldemort's real name in Harry Potter is mentioned to be an anagram in the second book, so it's been localised so it can become an acronym in the localised versions (EN: “Tom Marvolo Riddle“ -&gt; I am Lord Voldemort. ES: “Tom Sorvolo Ryddle” -&gt; “Soy Lord Voldemort”).

In other cases (i.e. marketing or training) a client might use fictional names as examples for situations, and they might require you to provide names that are common in your locale (not necessarily related to the actual meaning in the name).",TranslationStudies,1,1603911221,

While in USA MMS quickly got traction after SMS, that never happened in LatAm. Companies never gave out unlimited SMS in subscriptions, and MMS remained quite expensive.

Example from a comment further down...

a Wife is at the restaurant and the husband is kind of oogling the waitresses ample and juicy breasts:

wife is *jealous* to the waitress because she fears to lose her husbands  attention (which due to matrimony *belongs* to her).

She *envies* the attention that the waitress is getting.

Totally different things related to the same matter.


Say the husbands attention is 100 pieces. He is currently giving 20% of it(oogling) to the waitress and 80 to wife (sitting with her at the table).

she envies those 20% the waitress already has.. because those are the 20% that are full of sexual desire..


she is jealous that the 80% she *still* has due to contractual duties might be lost in near future.


I hope this helped understand it better.. yes.. the argument that this is colloquially used wrong is true.. it does not justifies to continue using it in a wrong manner.

ckg69fx,zachinoz,"Hi. The CEO of Kickstarter said in the New York Times that the project drove more traffic to the site than any other had and that the film had in actuality had the exact opposite effect of your rehashed and incorrect talking points. It had, as he said, ""A halo effect;"" my fans joined and stayed and funded other projects.

The big corps had no interest in making the movie. I have not pocketed anything and will likely lose some money on the film I have dedicated 3 years of my life to. It was not a profit exercise, but rather an artistic integrity one. Your spin is from the viewpoint of someone who's quite cynical and sees the negative rather than the positive. A piece of content was made by willing participants that never would have been made. They attend an advanced screening and a Q&amp;A, or get a t-shirt or an outgoing voicemail message and that money pays for the content. It does not go into my pocket. 

If profit was my goal I would go back to network TV. I may do just that again. That is where actors make money, not making movies about sad, out of work Jews.

I am on Reddit quite a bit. Everyday. I don't post that often; I didn't know that regular commenting was required. But if you look at my history listed above, I have and do comment occasionally on something that has nothing to do with me and I upvote and downvote quite often.

Donald is my best friend. He currently lives in my house. It is not pandering to the fans to let them know that Scrubs created a lifelong friendship that continues in much the same vein as the characters they fell in love with. It's quite rare that that ever happens in the industry and it's understandable that fans would enjoy it.

""Fuck those nerds at Reddit, right?"" Wow. Is that how you see this site and yourself? It's not how I see it. I recommend Celexa; it is strong but adds an Instagram-like filter to Earth.

You liked Scrubs, but not the lead character from who's POV the story was told and narrated? Did you not like Skywalker in ""Star Wars"" or Parsons on ""Big Bang"" or Norton in ""Fight Club""?

In short, I love this site. It's one of my favorites on the web. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that people like you can spew hate for no good reason. Of course you don't have to like me, but there's no reason you can't be kinder and better informed.

But if you don't work through the pain and instead avoid therapy saying it is making your arm ""worse"", sure, you avoid that TEMPORARY pain that you need to work through, but you also never heal your arm.  Same with the exercise and getting out.  If you just keep avoiding it, instead of working through it and letting your brain balance things back out, you will be sick a lot longer.  I saw many in the withdrawal groups keep avoiding thigns that set them off, ""waiting' for things to settle back down.  The reality is most made themselves worse, and had things go even more crazy once they tried doing things because they kept themselves so isolated and afraid to do things.

If I go into a movie theater that is dark, and the movie lets out, my eyes have to adjust.  They will not adjust if I stay in the dark theater, the opposite happens - the longer I stay in the dark, the more sensitive my eyes get. It is only by going out into the light and allowing yourself to feel the discomfort that your eyes adjust.  just like the only way your body is going to get back to normal is by you doing the things you need to do, even if they seem ""triggering' a bit.  Otherwise, you are going back in the same ""dark theater"" just waiting for your eyes to suddenly be adjusted to the light outside, which never happens. 

Don't be one of those people who sits around for months or years doing nothing because it ""makes you worse"", the reality is something you need to do the hard things to get better, even if it is uncomfortable.",benzorecovery,1,1603904072,

try to avoid him. seek his parents while he is working. seek his bosses and co workers while he is at home. 

expect retaliation. do not block his number or texts. if he threatens you, call the police and show them when you need to. possible buy a small tape recorder to record phone calls he makes after you pass him off. people never expect that. do not tell him your plan or that you have him recorded. (save voicemails) People do not act smart when super pissed off. 

after you get the info to the right people, if he is mad and crazy... you may need a restraining order or something. I dunno. save any communications to prove intended harm. 

part of being a vengeful asshole, is being smart. plan for what he is going to do. You probably know him pretty well I assume. You need to judge this.

g9yj2pr,Merry_Little_Liberal,"I enjoyed the presitge and momento. shutter island was fine. I liked the story to it, Leo did good. I think if it wasn't for his good acting I may not have liked it too much. 

There is a cinematic term called an ""ask"". Meaning the things that the storyteller asks you to accept WITHOUT RESERVATION. The hardest ""ask"" in any movie would be... the entire movie is not what you think it is.  It is a hard concept to achieve. Shutter Island does a pretty good job in my opinion of pulling off one of the hardest ""asks"" in the business. The movie almost NEEDS to be watched twice to hit as hard as it does, which isn't bad, just really hard to do. 

Movies that do not achieve this leave you in a state of disbelief, thinking well, that is just Too Much of a stretch. You can find yourself watching again with the attempt to find holes (since you now know the ending). 


The prestige was very entertaining, although I think Christian Bale had a much cooler story line than wolverine. I found the water tank thing a bit much, why wouldn't he just do it once, and make friends with the clone? I find myself asking things like that. 

Momento is just great. shot great. directed great, good flow. I enjoy that movie every time I watch it. 

If you liked The Prestige you can try The Illusionist with Edward Norton. It is more centered on a love story you may not feel super into, but is often compared to the Prestige, of you like Magic. 

Murder on the Orient Express was another solid mystery movie. Well acted by a few stars all playing minor roles. Obviously you can always read it too if you like mystery books. Agatha Christie is just a BEAST with these stories, as they captured the imagination of people probably like your grandparents age.

Obviously it was a who dunnit, type movie... just found it absolutely flat. 

We are both Agatha Christie fans, we love to figure movies out before the ending. 

There was nothing here. great actors, it was funny in bits, which was nice. But there was absolutely too much foreshadowing. When it ended, we were still waiting on another twist or something to happen. 

A good movie, that is widely available (assuming you have not read the book) Was Murder on the Orient Express. 

Obviously not designed to be funny, but really well acted and a much more clever type of movie. 

We both knew how it ended as it was tied fairly similar to the book in many ways.... still had more mystique and mystery in the telling and would be a much bigger payoff had we never read the book.

There are many Italian dishes that are insanely over complicated. 

Work on getting your flavors right, and don't immediately focus on making your pasta from scratch. 

You can use existing things, like pre jarred sauces, boxed pasta, and flavor them up with meats and spices... 

Tomato Sauce being the biggest of everything... making a homemade tomato sauce, starting with crushed tomatoes, and soaking your meats in them for flavor, (meatballs, sausages) and letting it stu on the over for 10 hours is a lot to ask... 

Use a jarred marinara sauce, and add your own flavors to it via Italian style seasonings... Making homemade meatballs is a good starter for example. 

Learning the basic of meatballs, and then using a jarred sauce to soak them is a good place to start. 

Pasta out of the box is a good place to start. 

Learning to fry up chicken cutlets with good Italian flavor is a good way to start. 


If you try to do a homemade sauce, and homemade pasta, and you are building flavor from the ground up... I can see it being a little overwhelming, and disappointing, discouraging. 

Start with the basics, meatballs, pan fried... chicken cutlets,

You can learn a few pan fried chicken dishes like chicken Francese, piccata, too. There are lots of recipes for Italian styled chicken... but flavoring a red sauce to your liking is key for many many dishes.

Either the dog, the suicide, the general nature of the preacher. Religion ruled and ruined everybody's life simultaneously. 

I dont think it was terrible by any means. I was rooting for spiderman, I understood his actions and his side. His justifications were mostly warranted, which is key for ""rooting for the bad guy"" Walter White effect. I had some trouble understanding the corrupt cop's motivation, besides protecting his sister... but he really didn't have to after she uhhhh.. yknow.

cqyfw60,dogedriver,"Yeah...

I really wasn't interested in responding to the tough love here but there are some things to clarify.

You really have no idea how much time I spend working on marketing. Just because TV shows one thing doesn't mean that is reality. There isn't much exciting to show with me sitting at my desk and sending out emails. I work from 6am into the night hours, we don't even have a marketing person at PPR- it's me. That said, I don't want to be a marketing guy. I drive race cars. I have always been really good at it whether the smoke and mirrors of NASCAR shows it or not. I work most on being great at driving cars. If in the end I lose my job, it's not going to be because I wasn't good enough or didn't work hard at what my calling is- which is not making cold calls.

As far as Gene goes, you really have no idea what you are talking about. He is one of the smartest most hard working people I have ever met and he is a fierce competitor. I def will not tolerate a bashing of him. HE IS why we are able to make races, outrun cars that we have no business outrunning, and even make it to the track on most weeks.

As far as Daytona goes. A wire was frayed internally on a fuel pump. So once again, will not tolerate the bashing of the crew. Not cool when you have no idea how many all nighters those guys pulled to BUILD OUR CARS FROM SCRATCH. The large teams had 400+ employees to to the job that our 4 people did over the winter. The small teams have 25-40 people to do the job that our 4 guys did over the winter. Daytona was a horrific way to start the season but it was the nature of the beast for the hand we are dealt. 

Not even sure if I covered everything there but most of your information was misinformation, misunderstanding and misleading. 

I Prob come across like a total d**k right here but I feel the need to be as direct as possible.

I appreciate your support.",NASCAR,94,1430777821,Josh Wise

cqg2oaa,dogedriver,"Hey!

I am not really sure - would be the most honest and simple answer.

If we don't reach the goal I believe teespring won't print the shirts? I am not positive on this though, I did not have any hand in setting it up other than giving my blessing and excitement when I was asked about it. I don't like to come on here and try to sell you guys stuff.

If we do reach the goal it will really help us finalize funding for what we already have for the dogecar (10k). I thought Daytona would be a pretty cool race to run the DOGECAR at.

All this said-I do not own the team and I really act as a middle man on most of this. Phil is all on board for us pulling this off and I have made sure he is aware of what is in motion. If for some reason we are short of what it takes to fund a race for us, which is around 55k, and another sponsor wants to pay full price for that race, we will probably have to move the race. The best way to lock this in is to sell enough to cover a full race sponsorship.

Ideally- we need to exceed the goal that is set here, by a lot! Ideally. Remember it took 5k shirts to truly fund the race at Talladega. 

We have always made sure to be more than fair in how we handle the sponsorship dollars- you will recall we added an extra race at Sonoma last year because we exceeded the goals and also ran a partial scheme at Watkins Glen last season just as a fun thank you.

I think the best way to look at this is let's try and sell as many as we can! These are cool shirts and I am going to buy some! ANY funding generated by this helps our team out so I am truly thankful for that. I want nothing more than to see a full DOGECAR wrap at Daytona!! Let's just have some fun with it all, get some cool shirts and get this DOGECAR back on track!

I hope that helps although I feel like I don't have as many answers as I was hoping for. 
To summarize- we need to generate 55k and DOGECAR is locked into Daytona in July! Anything short of that and we will have to see how it all stacks up. 

Thanks for the great question

I have also been in contact with GOCOIN and they are interested in setting up some sort of multi altcoin contest where the highest donations from each currency receive prime placement on the car etc. it would be a fun way to get a full sponsorship.

cmcxueh,dogedriver,"Nothing too religious IMO it's all about balance.

The biggest thing for me was eliminating anything processed. Basically only eating fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, beans, eggs, and limited lean meat and dairy (one small serving of each per day) was where I found the best balance. I am sure everyone's needs are different on this stuff.

You prob already know this but I will state the obvious. By eliminating processed foods and breads you are taking out tons of processed sugars from your diet. I used a lot of healthy fats to supplement the caloric needs which in turn really increases your body's ability to fuel off of fat instead of sugars. Which means you can go fast for longer.

About Ashlyn:

Ashlyn is a 10 year old quarter midget driver from Elk Grove, CA. She will  be beginning her third year of racing in 2015. Since she began racing at the age of 9, she has won six races, five fast times, and won the Rookie of the Year. Racing is not Ashlyn's only accomplishment. She is also on her schools District Honor Role.
 
Ashlyn has been around racing her whole life. Her grandfather raced sprint cars at the legendary ASCOT Speedway. Her dad, Johnny, was also a race car driver. He started in quarter midgets in 1983 and retired in 2010 driving sprintcars and midgets. When Ashlyn was only two weeks old she was at Irwindale Speedway, watching her dad race a USAC Midget.
 
Ashlyn is always cheered on by her biggest supporters, her mother Jaime and younger sister Aven. Ashlyn said she would like to race 600cc Micro sprints and some day race a sprint car like her dad.",dogecoin,236,1416106994,Racing Shibe

I would say you are far from chasing your tails. We are trying to establish a new currency and while dogecoins rapid growth is very impressive- this is not an overnight process by any means.

You can be sure that the owners of Provident know many other business owners and that they have probably shared their experience with them. There may not be overnight conversions but the more it comes up in a conversation or an advertisement or someone mentioning they would like to purchase with Dogecoin- those are the things that will creat the change over time.

d962p4b,ColChrisHadfield,"I, too love science, and have always had to balance the pragmatism of passion vs income vs family. You never get it quite right, but the continued re-balancing is important - in fact, it's your life. My wife and I would both be quick to point out that giving up on your dreams does not come for free. Recognize that. We've also always held that extra and continuing education is key. 

You mention 'the current political climate'. If you wait for the political climate to be just right, Hell may freeze over. Here's what I recommend: 

Have a plan that takes care of the fundamental needs of you and your loved ones. Keep that going as the centre of your life as much as you possibly can. But always be looking for ways to pursue the things that you are passionate about. There are always options and other ways to do things. A PhD is daunting at the outset, but 10 years afterwards it will just be what you chose to do during that period of your life. They key is passion - you'll need it to sustain you during all the extra work and trade-offs and time crunches and things that go wrong.
 
Finally, make a decision, stick with it, and own it. Your decisions define who you turn into. They occasionally need adjusting, and often they take more time than you'd like. Expect that, and, most importantly, be deliberately joyful with each new skill, each new insight. There's more than one finish line in life, and only you can judge your own success.

The best thing you can do is train yourself to enjoy building up the skills that end up defining who you are.

Becoming the thing you dream of is a long shot, no matter what. The key is to HAVE a dream, a destination, a personal definition of perfection in life, and then to use that end goal to help decide what to do next. It is not the end goal that changes you, but the summed total of each of the small, daily decisions. Actively pursue your dreams by deliberate small choices - what to eat, to read, how to exercise, what to study, where to go, when to change direction. It's amazing where all the little decisions can lead you. 

Never hate what you are doing. Make the most of it, find pleasure in the nuance and the art of it, become better at it, laugh at it, make it one of the things that you can do. If it's truly insufferable, then you must change and do something else. But get the most out of each step of life as you go. There's always more there than you think. 
And celebrate success now! Don't wait to walk on the Moon to notice the thousand small victories that got you there. Rejoice in each new skill, every discovered idea, each small improvement you make in yourself. 
All the choices and ideas you list make sense. Do what is closest to your heart, the ones that make you the most excited. That way you are inevitably turning yourself into who you want to be.

Edit: Sorry for the confusion on my reply. I had answered a similar question elsewhere, and addressed the more philosophical side. To be specific: Get an advanced technical degree, at least a Masters, in a field that interests you. Your work in Physics is fine. It's no so much what you've learned, but a proven ability to learn complex things. Maintain your health - eat and exercise to keep a strong, fit body. Likely worth getting a physical, to know what peculiarities you may have - heart, vision, height, weight, etc. You can then compare that to the required standards of the various space agencies. Once school is complete, work in a field where your decisions matter, have consequence, to prove your ability to make good decisions. It's why the CSA hires pilots, doctors, people who have managed programs, etc. Then gain other skills - scuba, flying, languages, climbing, engine/computer repair, etc. What might make you stand out in selection, and useful on a spaceship?

Once we have solved the problems there of power generation, water/air recycling, food production, radiation protection, communication, navigation, psychology, in-situ resource usage and propulsion, then we will be ready to not just send probes to Mars, but to move there.

It has been a year since my son and I created and released the [Space Oddity video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo). We have been amazed and delighted that so many people enjoyed it - and maybe saw what spaceflight can  really be like. It helped show that humans have left Earth, and that the Space Station is a new stage, for not just science and exploration, but for our art and music too. With exploration comes insight – with perspective comes self-realization.

We had permission from David Bowie’s people to post the video on YouTube for a year, and that year is up. We are working on renewing the license for it, but as there are no guarantees when it comes to videos shot in space, we thought you might want to have one last look before we take it down. 

Thanks for everything. You've all been incredible throughout.

I realised at a pretty young age that my oldest brother was one of those people who only talks to you when he needs something. Usually that something is money or babysitting.

I avoid him at all costs but usually end up calling him out on his behaviour when it happens. 

My middle brother I have a lot of empathy for because he has a lot of issues, but unfortunately the way he deals with them is toxic. He was a teenage parent and was expelled from school for fighting, and after a few years struggling he unfortunately turned to drugs and developed a serious mental health issues that led to a suicide attempt. My parents tried to support him the best they could emotionally and set him up with rehab and mental health treatment for the things they didn’t have the expertise to handle, and I loaned them £7k to pay off his drug debts on the condition that he never found out the money was from me (they pretended to him they had taken out a bank loan) and that they payed me back even if he didn’t pay them back. He got into trouble shoplifting, rehab didn’t work for him, he lost custody of his kid, and blocked our parents from contacting him at all. I tried to stay in contact with him but he pulled away every time I attempted, and I eventually had to make the decision not to try anymore and when he eventually wants me and wants help he will contact me.

I’m not friends with any of my ex’s but I am friends with an ex fwb and my partner and I regularly meet him together and they are friends with each other too. He trusts that there is nothing between us any more and no cheating - emotional or physical - would ever happen. 

I think being really upfront about it from the beginning in both cases was really important and neither of us ever felt we had to hide the past.

It was a viscous circle and it killed our relationship because every time we were intimate non-sexually (just as lying in bed cuddling) I felt that he was only doing it to hopefully lead to sex.

It helps me sleep without knocking me out, increases my appetite and decreases nausea meaning I’m now a healthy weight, doesn’t decrease my sex drive, and massively helps with panic attacks.

He doesn’t know that Jess took Rory’s bracelet, and neither does Rory, so how angry/upset Rory anticipates him being seems kinda irrational. 

His actions make sense to us because we do know those things, and it makes sense to him in hindsight because at the end of the day Rory does end up with Jess, but at the time he is overreacting and often cruel to her.

No Marcellus wants people to give him what he wants, and if he killed the kid, he'd send the wrong message, if he rewarded the kid, then he's unlikely to snitch, and it sends the message that you do right by marcellus he does right by you.

Any benefits of using OUs in AD really depends on your scenario.

  In production SaaS applications with AD, of the solution I've implemented, the one I found to work best was seperate domains for each tier and one way trusts to a managment domain for users, and only OUs for users, but just to keep them in general buckets.

 Then using GPOs with WMI and group targeting to selectively assign the GPOs to groups of systems and users and apllying them at the root of rhe domain.

This made ir a lot easier since you have to manually move computers to other Ous or create their accounts and then join them, while users I could create accounts in specific OUs whenever, wirhout additional work.

gaacmfl,ReginaldJohnston,"&gt;How is even possible to recover 17trillion debt? With GREAT. leadership it' is easy.

It's now $26.7 trillion with a predict $3.3 trillion rise over the next fiscal year.

Just to break this down: the national debt was $17 trillion up to 2018-19 fiscal year with an interest of $475 billion.

That essentially meant that every US household per capita is liable for about $600,000 to have been paid by last September before accumulating interest.

This fiscal year now, it's now $27.7 trillion, meaning per capita debt has leapt to $900,000 and is still rising.

This explains Biden's comments on raising taxes to control the cuts from federal services, welfare, Medicare, infrastructure and obviously Coronavirus.

You are ordering an extra-large pizza for a class. 

A large fraction of the students, 3/5th of them, want mushrooms. 

And of that group, half of them want extra cheese.

 So the easiest way is to first slice the pie into 5 equal sections and put mushrooms on 3 of those slices. 

 Now cut these three in half, and add extra cheese to one of these halves. 

So you end up with extra cheese on 1/2 of 3/5 of the original pizza, which is 3/10 of it. 

In other words, you might as well have divided the original pizza into 10 pieces and added the extra cheese to 3 of them. 

That is your 3/5 x 1/2 = 3/10

Btw, you can imagine this a slab of chocolate if a rectangular shape is more intuitive to you. (but don't add mushrooms or cheese to chocolate!)

And, you could also start by dividing the original in 2  and then adding cheese to 3/5 of one of the halves. You get extra cheese on the same surface area.

As for your question on ""multiplication should increase and not decrease"", think of fractional multiplication as ""a fraction of"". Ie, half of three-fifth of the original will always keep reducing.",explainlikeimfive,1,1603510266,

I fully empathize with your feelings, and don't want to minimize your sense of outrage, but I hope you are able to view this a bit dispassionately. 

First of all, it is not certain that your dad is type O. Siblings' blood types can and are always varied. Unless **both** your grandma and grandpa are O, their offsprings can have different types.

That said, maybe you are right, and your Dad is O, which means he is not your bio-dad.  Even if so, you should try and take this slowly, maybe talk to a therapist.  'Blood relationships' is an archaic way of looking at family, and I feel you don't really agree with your Dad's rigid stance on this, and if that's true, you are correct. Family is made from being together, caring and sharing. That's not just a cliche but real life.  If you felt close to your dad before this came up, then there's no reason you should feel different, unless you *want* to make an issue of it; and I would gently advise you not to. If you were already not close to your dad, it still would serve no purpose pursuing it further to find out who your 'real' father is - your dad remains your real dad, and nobody else can be it, even if there's a bio-relationship. 

I have a close friend who's exactly in your boat.  He surmised using blood types that he couldn't be his Dad's - a cousin of his got into an accident and needed a lot of blood and he found his Dad's blood type then, and the chart did not match. He confided in me because he wanted to tell somebody, and we bottled the secret up. Recently his wife realized this when their daughter was doing the chart at school for all family, and she was shocked that he never bought it up to his mother (still alive) or his dad when he was alive.  He said he did not want to change his relationships with them - his mom was and is loving and he did not want to hurt her; his dad was the typical hands-off male dad, and he did not want to make it more awkward. His wife even tried to recruit me to convince him to confront his mother, but I declined and she seems to finally accept that there's nothing to be gained by airing this knowledge. 

I realize this is just anecdotal, but I sincerely hope you can talk to some therapist unconnected to your personal life and sort it out. Try and understand what would you gain by bringing it out in the open, and if that gain is tangible or just wishful. This might cause a lot of upheavals in your family, and maybe beyond, if your bio-parent comes in the picture without him knowing beforehand. You might feel resentful of your mom, but don't act just to even things up or to show her up as a hypocrite. That will only have short-term satisfaction; in the long term, you should be happy with yourself. 

You could also ask your doctor if your health conditions might be better served knowing your biological links, or at this point it is just academic because they can and should be treating you as you are now. 

I wish you well!",confessions,1,1603373583,

From what I remember, a balding, fat guy had purchased a brand-new remote control for his television, and he had kicked off his viewing experience by watching the same footage on which I had become so fixated.

Following the return of the man's wife, he started to have trouble with the remote, with said trouble culminating in the fellow getting sucked into whatever program was on the screen at the time.

No pun intended.

Anyway, while I had previously by fascinated by ""collecting coupons"" (which was code for ""stealing all of the lingerie advertisements out of the Sunday paper), the aforementioned recording soon became my favorite piece of media. Whenever my parents were out of the house, I'd have the tape in the VCR, queued up to the exact moment when the nude goddess made her debut. I must have watched that precious handful of seconds at least a hundred times... and whenever I did, I'd keep constantly glancing at the family dog.

See, whenever a car pulled into the driveway, my canine companion would go sprinting toward the front door to greet whoever was returning. Even before then, though, if the dog's ears perked up, it meant that a vehicle was approaching (but was not yet audible to me). That small signal meant that I had just enough time to eject the tape, stash it away, turn off the television, and set myself up to look like I had been doing something acceptably innocuous.

Many years later, when I was reminiscing about pets with my mother, she confessed to having been aware that I'd been up to *something*... but thanks to that keen-eared dog, I never did get caught.

Introverts are not quiet, shy, or company-averse by default.

Extroverts mentally recharge by spending time around other people, whereas introverts need some time alone to relax. That's literally the only difference between the two. Think of socialization like playing a particularly grueling sport of some variety, if that helps: Introverts might be tired and sore afterward, but they wouldn't bother with the activity at all if they didn't enjoy it. Furthermore, introversion has absolutely nothing to do with social awkwardness, social anxiety, or shyness.

You also don't have to take my word for it:

------

&gt;Although introverts do generally need — and enjoy — more solitude than their extroverted counterparts, **the idea that introverts are antisocial or don’t want the company of others is completely false**.

------

That's from [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/09/01/introvert-myths_n_3569058.html). 

If you'd like a more robust source, though, here's an excerpt from [Scientific American](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/will-the-real-introverts-please-stand-up/):

------

&gt;Finally, there's a common misconception that all introverts enjoy solitary activities. However, that isn't a defining feature of introverts. Responses such as ""Enjoy spending time by myself"" and ""Live in a world of my own"" involve an equal blend of introversion and intellect/imagination. **Contrary to popular conceptualizations of introversion, preferring to be alone is not the main indicator of introversion**.

That doesn't stop shy, socially anxious, or socially awkward people from calling themselves ""introverts,"" though, because it's a much more pleasant self-description than any of those other options.

g9mrlaq,ramsesthepigeon,"The joke here might be a bit too ""mature"" for much of Reddit's current demographic.

Still, let me see if I can explain.

If you're past a certain age – we'll say twenty-five or so, just for the sake of slapping a random number into things here – you've likely encountered an Oreo-centric sort of comical, diet-based denial being voiced by people. Basically, folks know that the cookies are unhealthy, but they still eat entirely too many of them. This has given rise to the ubiquitous (again, for people past a certain age) understanding that ""a serving"" of Oreos is not what is listed on the package, but rather an amount which can only be described as ""too many.""

The post that we are currently discussing begins with this premise, then expands on it by offering the tongue-in-cheek suggestion that thirteen Oreos is ""a serving."" The poster has thus cast themselves as a buffoon who is prone to over-indulgence, with a second layer of humor arising from the fact that their audience – the people in this thread – will likely play along with that perspective. (You can see that the top comment is claiming that an entire box is actually a serving.)

It certainly isn't a complicated joke, but it is one which relies on a person being familiar with certain cultural connotations and undertones... and it also requires the knowledge that thirteen Oreos is an absurd amount to be regarded as a single serving.

------

Now that the above explanation has been offered, here it is again... but written in a way that may aid certain people's understanding.

g9m8vn3,ramsesthepigeon,"That's a common misconception, but it isn't true.

As it happens, there is no specific serving size for Oreos. The number that you're supposed to eat is defined by a surprisingly complex equation, the final figure of which almost always comes out to ""all of the available Oreos.""

That might seem a bit odd, so let me explain.

Suppose that you purchased a box containing ten sleeves of thirteen Oreos each. Common sense would seem to dictate that you'd have four options for a serving size:

1. You can eat one sleeve, thereby having ten servings. (You cannot eat less than a single sleeve, owing to the fact that the Oreos might become stale if you don't finish them. You don't know that for sure, of course, but you don't want to risk it.)
2. You can eat two sleeves, thereby having five servings. (Eating three or four sleeves would result in an uneven distribution across servings, meaning that you'd be unable to enjoy at least one of them.)
3. You can eat five sleeves, thereby having two servings. (Eating six sleeves would result in that same uneven distribution.)
4. You can eat all ten sleeves, thereby having one serving.

Now, on the surface, that *seems* to be a fair number of options... but the array is actually somewhat deceptive: You need to eat approximately a fifth of the available Oreos before you really start to truly appreciate them, simply because your tongue requires prolonged exposure to the cream filling before you can embrace the complexity of the flavor profile. Stopping there would deprive you of subsequent enjoyment, though, so you *actually* have to eat about half of the cookies (at minimum). There's also the fact that Oreo-consumption is a remarkably Zen activity – ""separate, examine, eat, eat"" being the simplest means of doing it – so you're likely to zone out a little bit at times, meaning that you need to eat two servings in order to have the experience of consuming a single one.

Working through this whole thing results in an inescapable conclusion: If you don't eat all of the Oreos, there's practically no point in having any at all. Oh, sure, folks will spout meaningless jargon-words like ""obesity"" or ""insulin shock"" or ""heart attack,"" but discerning Oreo-eaters know that such things are only offered from a place of envy. After all, if those naysayers *really* knew so much about the cookies, they'd know about the above-mentioned serving sizes.

g9js8gp,ramsesthepigeon,"There's a neighborhood in San Francisco called ""The Castro"" which has a reputation for being something of a haven for the city's homosexuals. A gargantuan rainbow flag flies over the main road into the district, a handful of gay and lesbian bars dot the area, and there's at least one shop that sells artwork of a rather provocative nature. While it has quieted down a bit in recent years, that open and occasionally flamboyant section of town used to be the site for one of the largest and most raucous Halloween gatherings I've ever had the chance to attend... and during one particularly memorable occasion, I witnessed one of the most extreme wardrobe malfunctions I could have imagined.

I had been making my way through the crowded streets, dodging around both the revelers and the picture-taking tourists, when I accidentally stumbled into something of an impromptu costume contest. A group of about thirty or so people had gathered into a small circle, in the center of which was a very attractive woman in a devil outfit. She hadn't just relied on her beauty to draw attention, either: This girl had painted herself from tip to tail in red makeup, fitted wicked-looking horns to her head, and somehow managed to contain her breasts within a strapless garment that looked like a cross between an ornate corset and an ancient torture device. The folks surrounding her applauded and cheered as she strutted around and smiled, raising their drinks in appreciation with each pose that she offered.

Needless to say, I stopped to watch.

After a few moments, the devil at the center of the ring took a bow and merged into the rest of the group. She was soon replaced by a second young woman, this one in a considerably less impressive costume. As near as I could tell, the newcomer was supposed to be a mummy, but she appeared to have simply wrapped herself in several rolls of toilet paper, then blackened her eyes to give them a look that wasn't so much ""undead"" as it was ""unrested."" The response from the crowd was still appreciative, but not as enthusiastic than it had previously been... at least until the girl shouted at the top of her lungs:

""Somebody get me a drink!""

As if on cue, dozens of onlookers immediately poured their beverages onto the young woman, who laughed and twirled around with her arms outstretched. (I personally found myself wondering why she seemed to be so unaffected by the cold, as San Francisco isn't exactly tropical in October.) In a way, it was lucky that she hadn't been dressed in something more expensive... but on the other hand, her attire was anything but waterproof. After a couple of errant splashes found their marks, the girl was suddenly naked from the waist up, her only coverings being a pair of white leggings and some rapidly disintegrating toilet paper.

The group's reaction to *that* blew the devil's out of the water.

Fortunately, the young woman seemed to take the sudden disappearance of her costume in stride. After a brief moment of apparent uncertainty, she threw her hands up, shrieked with delight, then bounced up and down as the crowd went wild.

Needless to say... I stayed to watch.

I know this because I had to recite that prayer every night for years... but I'll grant you that even constant repetition isn't enough for some people.

(I'll never forget the time when he shouted ""I'll see you in Hell!"" at a teacher, having mistakenly assumed that he'd learned an alien-language greeting from Han Solo.) This tendency was put in the spotlight one evening as he was supposed to be saying grace, after our mother insisted that he slow down and recite each word with the focus and conviction that she felt it deserved.

Comments were locked and removed, the aforementioned brigade eventually calmed down, and the numerous anti-China posts that obeyed the subreddit’s rules were all left in place.

Now, before you try to make up another conspiracy theory, ask yourself something: If China really did own Reddit (which it doesn’t; Tencent bought a 5%, non-controlling stake in the company), and if the CCP really were removing posts here (which they aren’t), why would they leave up all of the posts and comments calling that out?

“Plausible deniability!” I hear you shout... except that doesn’t make sense, either, given that there are entire subreddits devoted to manufacturing evidence of a conspiracy that doesn’t exist. If such a conspiracy *did* exist, its first step would be to infiltrate said subreddits and alter the narrative.

For some reason, the broadcast meteorologists glommed onto it this year, because it gives them something dramatic to talk about.

And with regards to the so-called “chemtrails” - what do these people think happens when a fine aerosol is released at 35,000 feet? Do they think it just falls to the ground underneath where they’re standing? The winds at that level are often 120-150 mph, which would blow anything like that apart and transport it hundreds or even thousands of miles away.

e7gg15u,sincewedidthedo,"In February 2003, ramping up for OIF, my unit flew into Kuwait City and had to chill there for a few hours before getting on some small buses and being driven through the desert, north to Camp Udairi. I had no idea how long of a drive it was, so I lounged around the staging area at the Kuwait Cuty airport, drinking coffee, smoking and joking.

Suddenly, it was time to go - we quickly loaded the buses with all of our battle rattle, and the driver started going.

About ten minutes into the drive, I knew the coffee was a terrible idea. Once we were north of the city, we were in wide open desert, and the road turned into more of a hard strip of sand. It was bouncy and bumpy and looked like it went on forever. About thirty minutes in, I had to piss - badly.

The “road” continued, seemingly getting bumpier and bumpier the further we went. I was getting desperate - I started eyeballing an empty water bottle rolling around on the floor, but it was only a 20 ounce - no way would that work.

An hour into the drive, I was in pain, nauseous, worried I might pass out, although at that point, that didn’t seem like such a bad prospect - if I passed out, I’d have an excuse for pissing myself, at least.

I looked around at the rest of the troops on the bus, irrationally angry, because they looked calm - reading, listening to music, etc. Was I the only one on the verge of dying from needing to piss?

Another 5-10 minutes, and I had resigned myself: *I’m going to piss my pants, here, now, on my way to a probable war, right next to my NCOIC.*

I was trying to figure out the most rational way to handle this impending horrible event when a Sergeant First Class stood up and yelled to the Kuwaiti driver: “Stop the bus - we need a piss break!”

Sweeter words, I’d never heard. The driver stopped - still in a wide-open expanse of desert - and I flew through the bus door as he opened it. Frantically, I fumbled with my gas mask strap, my LBV, my BDU pants button, and got my now thumbnail-sized dick out, free at least.

It took an excruciatingly long time for anything to happen, but when it finally started flowing, it was pure bliss. Nirvana. Unbridled joy, the likes of which I’ll likely never experience again.

I looked to my left, then to my right - a line of troops had formed on either side of me, our backs to the bus, and we all pissed freely into that wide open desert.

One soldier took a picture of us from behind, all lined up like that, although I never got the opportunity to see it - it was a disposable film type camera, so who knows if/when it got developed. If I were ever to come across that picture, though, I’d frame it and hang it somewhere prominently in my house. It was quite a moment.

So, while they aren’t in Kuwait, convoying off to some austere camp, those girls and I...well, we’re not that different.",trashyboners,270,1539099411,

But at the same time, if someone does not want to wear a mask and they are out in the outdoors or in public, they are taking the risk on themselves so if they get sick it's on them. The people who wear masks around them are protecting themselves with the masks, so they should STFU about people not wearing masks, it's not their business. Unless someone rips off their mask they are fine and should stop trying to make other people follow their expectations. If someone comes near you without a mask it's fair to tell them to get the fuck away from you, but you should never go up to someone who is minding their own business and demand they put on a mask.

Women with a history of idiopathic precocious puberty had increased rates of clinical hyperandrogenism, but [a study (Treated and untreated women with idiopathic precocious puberty: long‐term follow‐up and reproductive outcome between the third and fifth decades - Liora Lazar et al, 2013)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cen.12319) **found that fertility was normal in adulthood among those who had been treated for the condition**.

Those who had been treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog more often reported hyperandrogenism than matched controls (29.6% versus 17.4%, P=0.006), as did those who had received the older therapy cyproterone acetate (50% versus 20.4%, P=0.04), and those who were untreated (34.4% versus 17.2%, P=0.003)

Yet rates of spontaneous pregnancy were equivalent for those who received GnRH analog treatment and controls (90.4% versus 93.4%) as well as for those treated with cyproterone acetate (CyA) and controls (86.7% versus 90.2%)

Puberty blockers are more commonly known as GnRH analogs or GnRH agonists. They are also referred to as GnRHa treatment. These drugs interrupt the signals that the brain puts out to tell the body to start producing the hormones associated with puberty in both boys and girls.﻿ Before puberty, children have only small amounts of a hormone called GnRH—gonadotropin-releasing hormone. The hormone is released infrequently and at low amounts. When puberty starts, the body starts making more GnRH and releasing it more frequently. GnRHa treatment turns down that signal until doctors and patients are ready for puberty to begin. Puberty usually begins within 6 months to a year after stopping GnRHa treatment.",science,1,1602792781,

I believe that every who questions their gender identity should be supported in their quest for answers. A lot of the time it involves something as simple as changing your pronouns, name, or gender presentation, or talking it through with a therapist. 

&gt;Also, would you support giving ""trans"" children hormone therapy?

Please refer to my previous comment, it references the medical protocol regarding the administration of hormones to trans children. 

&gt; Because there is a lot of info out on how many people regret making those permanent changes to their bodies later in life.

You mean that there's a lot of MISinformation about how many people regret it later in life. 

Surgical regret is actually very uncommon. Virtually every modern study puts it below 4 percent, and most estimate it to be between 1 and 2 percent ([Cohen-Kettenis &amp; Pfafflin 2003, Kuiper &amp; Cohen-Kettenis 1998](http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-qtlZDCMAZ4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=transgenderism+and+intersexuality+in+childhood+and+adolescence&amp;ots=A4yTHR-Fvd&amp;sig=n8CXw7NhWSbNS33fsgam3XGu1PQ#v=onepage&amp;q=transgenderism%20and%20intersexuality%20in%20childhood%20and%20adolescence&amp;f=false), Pfafflin &amp; Junge 1998, [Smith 2005](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15842032), [Dhejne 2014](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/262734734_An_Analysis_of_All_Applications_for_Sex_Reassignment_Surgery_in_Sweden_1960-2010_Prevalence_Incidence_and_Regrets)). In some other recent longitudinal studies, none of the subjects expressed regret over medically transitioning ([Krege et al. 2001](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11564029),[ De Cuypere et al. 2006](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1158136006000491)).

These findings make sense given the consistent findings that access to medical care improves quality of life along many axes, including sexual functioning, self-esteem, body image, socioeconomic adjustment, family life, relationships, psychological status and general life satisfaction. This is supported by the numerous studies ([Murad 2010](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2265.2009.03625.x/abstract;jsessionid=B762F82F4564FB01651D68B07C5AEEAB.f01t04?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false), [De Cuypere 2006](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1158136006000491), [Kuiper 1988](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3219066), Gorton 2011, [Clements-Nolle 2006](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J082v51n03_04#.VGY3tCdOkkA)) that also consistently show that access to GCS reduces suicidality by a factor of three to six (between 67 percent and 84 percent).

The regret rate for GCS compares favorably with [gastric banding](http://psychcentral.com/news/archives/2006-07/jaaj-scg071306.html). 

When asked about regrets, [only 2 percent](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2640543/Two-thirds-Britons-REGRET-having-cosmetic-surgery.html) of respondents in a survey of transgender people in the UK had major regrets regarding the physical changes they had made, [compared with 65 percent](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2640543/Two-thirds-Britons-REGRET-having-cosmetic-surgery.html) of non-transgender people in the UK who have had plastic surgery.

g8xcyaq,drewiepoodle,"That's not how it works, and saying so is extremely unscientific and disingenuous. This adds to the copious amount of confusion and misinformation about gender dysphoria and transition related treatments. 

I've known I was trans since I was 7, my wife's doctor treated a patient who was 3. [Research suggests that children’s concept of gender develops gradually between the ages of three and five](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17650129)

Around 2-years-old, we become conscious of the physical differences between those assigned male and those assigned female. Before their 3rd birthday, most kids are easily able to label themselves. By age 4, most kids have a stable sense of their gender identity. During this same time of life, kids learn gender role behavior—that is, doing things generally associated with the masculine or feminine. They begin to play with kids of their own gender in activities identified with that gender. For example, a child may gravitate toward dolls and playing house. While another may play games that are more active and enjoy toy soldiers, blocks, and toy trucks.

One of the foremost researchers into childhood dysphoria has a paper listing all that we currently know about gender dysphoria in children. [Prepubescent Trans Children: What We Do
and Do Not Know](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2bzAPbcVls1eE5PSFJZQUpLX3M)

[A policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2018/09/13/peds.2018-2162) encourages pediatricians to provide gender-affirmative care and talk with children and families about gender issues from young childhood through adolescence. The statement provides practical information for clinicians and encourages pediatricians to start conversations early.

This is why the proper course of treatment for children with gender dysphoria follows [the Dutch Method](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22455322) starting with a social, reversible, non-medical one—allowing a child to change pronouns, hairstyles, clothes, and a first name in everyday life.

The Dutch approach on clinical management of both prepubertal children under the age of 12 and adolescents starting at age 12 with gender dysphoria, starts with a thorough assessment of any vulnerable aspects of the youth's functioning or circumstances and, when necessary, appropriate intervention. In children with gender dysphoria only, the general recommendation is watchful waiting and carefully observing how the dysphoria develops in the first stages of puberty. Currently, withholding physical medical interventions in these cases seems more harmful to wellbeing in both adolescence and adulthood when compared to cases where physical medical interventions were provided.

[The American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.news10.com/news/national/doctors-group-recommends-support-for-transgender-children/1453236542) recommended support for kids who change their names or hairstyles to affirm their chosen gender identity. The group said kids are more likely to have better physical and mental health with such support.

[A recent study](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext)  showed that trans children who socially transition early are comparable to cis children in measures of mental health.

[Another study shows that](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/02/24/peds.2015-3223) socially transitioned trans children who are supported in their gender identity have developmentally normative levels of depression and only minimal elevations in anxiety, suggesting that psychopathology is not inevitable within this group. Especially striking is the comparison with reports of children with gender dysphoria; socially transitioned trans children have notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among children with gender dysphoria living as the gender that they were assigned at birth.

As they approach puberty, the current guidelines (also based on the Dutch model) recommend the administration of puberty blockers to halt the progression of pubertal development. Puberty blocking allows a young person to explore gender and participate more fully in the mental health therapy process without being consumed by the fear of an impending developmental process that will result in the acquisition of undesired secondary sexual characteristics. GnRH agonists have been used safely for decades in children with other medical conditions, including central precocious puberty. These reversible treatments can also be used in adolescents who experience gender dysphoria to prevent development of secondary sex characteristics and provide time up until 16 years of age for the individual and the family to explore gender identity, access psychosocial supports, develop coping skills, and further define appropriate treatment goals. [A study](https://www.healio.com/pediatrics/journals/pedann/2014-6-43-6/%7Bbd70b796-b7bf-402d-98d7-f5ebf8c9e362%7D/the-peripubertal-gender-dysphoric-child-puberty-suppression-and-treatment-paradigms) describes the suggested guidelines when using blockers to treat trans children.

While current Endocrine Society guidelines recommend starting gender-affirming hormones around age 16, some specialty clinics and experts now recommend the decision to initiate gender-affirming hormones be individually determined, based more on state of development rather than a specific chronological age. 

Factors which support consideration of hormone initiation prior to age 16 include:

1. Length of time on GnRH analogues - for those whose endogenous puberty is suppressed in the earliest stages of puberty, waiting until age 16 to add hormones means a potential 5-7 year gap, during which bone mineral density is only accruing at a pre-pubertal rate. This could potentially impact peak bone mineral density, and place youth at risk for relative osteopenia/osteoporosis.
2. Experiencing puberty in the last years of high school or early college years presents multiple potential challenges. The emotional upheaval that occurs for youth undergoing puberty happens normally at 11 or 12 years of age. For those youth who struggle with emotional lability at that age, they do so in a relatively protected environment, regulated by parents/caregivers, and without access to potential dangers such as motor vehicles, drugs, alcohol and adult (or almost adult) peers and sexual partners. Having the physical appearance of a sexually immature 11 year old in high school can present emotional and social challenges that are amplified by gender dysphoria.
3. Available data from the Netherlands indicates that those youth who reach adolescence with gender dysphoria are unlikely to revert to a gender identity that is congruent with their assigned sex at birth.

[A 2013 study found that](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567\(13\)00187-1/fulltext)
 the intensity of early gender dysphoria appears to be an important predictor of persistence. 

As one research team concluded: “Explicitly asking children with gender dysphoria with which sex they identify seems to be of great value in predicting future outcomes for children with gender dysphoria.” That is, even within samples of gender nonconforming children, the ones who say they are the a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth are the ones who are most likely to say the same thing later in life.

Indications of more subtle childhood differences between persisters and desisters were reported in a [qualitative follow-up study of 25 gender non-conforming children](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1359104510378303). They found that both the persisters and desisters reported cross-gender identification from childhood, but their underlying motives appeared to be different. The persisters explicitly indicated that they believed that they WERE a gender other than the one assigned at birth. The desisters, however, indicated that they identified as the gender they were assigned at birth, but only wished that they were a different gender. 

[A study with 32 trans children](https://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/default+domain/iAZurUjEn4Z7SExt6uPm/full), ages 5 to 12, [indicates that](http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-01-transgender-kids-gender-identity.html) their gender identity is deeply held and not the result of confusion about gender identity or pretense.  The study is one of the first to explore gender identity in trans children using implicit measures that operate outside conscious awareness and are less susceptible to modification than self-report measures.

Some kids do grow out of it, and for those that do, they can detransition, and/or stop the treatment of hormone blockers and puberty of the gender they were assigned at birth is allowed to proceed.

[A study found that](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract) a clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides gender dysphoric youth who seek gender reassignment from early puberty on, the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults.

According to [a literature review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221385871830305X?via%3Dihub#bib23), gender-affirming hormones and surgery appear to improve mental health and quality of life in trans adolescents. Short-term changes in metabolic and safety variables do not seem to pose a clinical risk as long as treatment is medically supervised and monitored.

We will soon have more data as [the largest ever study](http://www.nature.com/news/largest-ever-study-of-transgender-teenagers-set-to-kick-off-1.19637) of trans teenagers is currently underway. [Link to the grant info](http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-HD082554-01A1).",science,1,1602788320,

Anthropologists have documented cultures around the world that acknowledge more than two genders.

Long before Cook’s arrival in Hawaii, a multiple gender tradition existed among the Kanaka Maoli indigenous society. The mahu could be biological males or females inhabiting a gender role somewhere between or encompassing both the masculine and feminine. Their social role is sacred as educators and promulgators of ancient traditions and rituals.

In pre-colonial Andean culture, the Incas worshipped the chuqui chinchay, a dual-gendered god. Third-gender ritual attendants or shamans performed sacred rituals to honor this god. The quariwarmi shamans wore androgynous clothing as “a visible sign of a third space that negotiated between the masculine and the feminine, the present and the past, the living and the dead.”

Prior to colonization, the Ankole people in what is now Uganda elected a woman to dress as a man and thereby become an oracle to the god Mukasa.

Among the Sakalavas of Madagaskar, little boys thought to have a feminine appearance were raised as girls. The Antandroy and Hova called their gender crossers sekrata who, like women, wore their hair long and in decorative knots, inserted silver coins in pierced ears, and wore many bracelets on their arms, wrists and ankles.

The indigenous Zapotec culture of Oaxaca is not divided by the usual dichotomies: gay or straight, male or female. There's a commonly accepted third category of mixed gender — people called muxes. (said to derive from mujer — Spanish for ""woman""). Some are men who live as women, or who identify beyond a single gender.

Fa'afafine are people who identify themselves as a third-gender in Samoa, American Samoa and the Samoan diaspora. A recognized gender identity/gender role since at least the early 20th century in Samoan society, and some theorize an integral part of traditional Samoan culture, fa'afafine are male at birth, and explicitly embody both masculine and feminine gender traits, fashioned in a way unique to this part of the world.

Indonesia recognizes a third gender, ""waria"". One ethnic group, the Bugis (numbering around 3 million people) recognize five genders. Their language offers five terms referencing various combinations of sex, gender and sexuality: makkunrai (“female women”), oroani (“male men”), calalai (“female men”), calabai (“male women”) and bissu (“transgender priests”). These definitions are not exact, but suffice.

In Pakistan and Bangladesh, the hijras are officially recognized as third gender by the government, being neither completely male nor female. In India also, transgender people have been given the status of third gender and are protected as per the law despite the social ostracism. The term more commonly advocated by social workers and transgender community members themselves is khwaja sira and can identify the individual as a transsexual person, transgender person (khusras), cross-dresser (zenanas) or eunuch (narnbans).

Kathoey or katoey refers to either a transgender woman or an effeminate gay male in Thailand. A significant number of Thais perceive kathoeys as belonging to a third gender, including many kathoeys themselves, while others see them as either a kind of man or a kind of woman. However, when considering transgender women (MtF) as a group in Thai society, most refer to themselves as phuying (""women""), with a minority referring to themselves as phuying praphet song (a ""second kind of woman"") and only very few referring to themselves as kathoey.

Anthropological research indicates well over 100 instances of diverse gender expression in Native American tribes at the time of early European contact. The most common modern term for the gender non-conforming members is ""Two Spirit"" (also two-spirit or twospirit) used by some indigenous North Americans to describe certain spiritual people - gay, lesbian, bisexual and gender-variant individuals - in their communities. The term was adopted in 1990 at an Indigenous lesbian and gay international gathering to encourage the replacement of the anthropological term berdache.

""Two Spirit"" is not interchangeable with ""LGBT Native American""; this title differs from most western, mainstream definitions of sexuality and gender identity in that it is not so much about whom one sleeps with, or how one personally identifies; rather, it is a sacred, spiritual and ceremonial role that is recognized and confirmed by the Elders of the Two Spirit's ceremonial community. While some have found the term a useful tool for intertribal organizing, not all Native cultures conceptualize gender or sexuality this way, and most tribes use names in their own languages. While some terms are not always appropriate or welcome, ""two spirit"" has generally received more acceptance and use than the term it replaced.

Individual tribes often also have their own classifications, there's the wíŋkte among the Lakota, the mixuga among the Ponca, the badé among the Crow, and many others. These are all third gender roles adopted by males, somewhat analogous to what we might think of as a transgender woman today. They're not exactly equivalent of course. In general, these third gender roles were liminal social positions, standing somewhere between the categories of Man and Woman - being neither, but having traits of both in addition to traits that are unique unto itself. 

The degree to which a third gender person could shift fluidly between Man, Woman, and Third Gender roles varied among cultures. Osh-Tisch, the most famous badé, for example generally adopted the attire of women and engaged in women's work, but when war came to the Crow, Osh-Tisch adopted men's clothing and fought with the men (earning the rather badass name Finds-Them-and-Kills-Them). Among the Crow of that time (late 1800s), Osh-Tisch's gender fluidity was considered less remarkable than the fact that a woman,The Other Magpie, also fought alongside Osh-Tisch. Like most badé, Osh-Tisch never married but did have at least one long-term relationship with a man and perhaps another with a woman (who may be The Other Magpie). When the US forced their own ideas of gender on the Crow, the people rallied in defense of the badé. Though Osh-Tisch was eventually forced by US agents to adopt what they deemed appropriate attire and labor for a man, the badé managed to keep many of the traditions associated with that gender role alive.

In Diné (Navajo) society, they traditionally have had five genders: female-in-woman (asdzaan), male-in-man (hastiin), nadleeh (like hermaphrodite or androgyny or gender fluidity), woman-in-man nadleehi (feminine gender), and then man-in-woman nadleeh (dilbah - masculine gender).

For the Navajo, it has less to do with sexual preference or biology than societal role. Most of the time, there was not much special about these people - they just were. Though society hierarchy meant that female-gendered individuals were more dominant (I guess that is the right word) because the feminine is the first gender. Nadleeh could be revered because they might express both male and female spirits perfectly, whereas every other gender could express only one spirit (it is with noting though that not every Nadleeh does, which is why sometimes people say ""at least” five genders - there is some wiggle room in there).

Even in the heart of Catholic Italy, in Naples, there is the centuries-old phenomenon of femminielli, those assigned male at birth who dress and behave as women. They are respected figures, traditionally believed to bring good luck, which may date back to pagan rituals of crossdressing, or eunuch priests.

This vast anthropological and archaeological evidence of multiple gender expression is often willfully ignored, but the reality is that gender non-conformity has been a part of human society since the very beginning, and it's not going anywhere.",science,1,1602784621,

Around 2-years-old, we become conscious of the physical differences between those assigned male and those assigned female. Before their 3rd birthday, most kids are easily able to label themselves. By age 4, most kids have a stable sense of their gender identity. During this same time of life, kids learn gender role behavior—that is, doing things generally associated with the masculine or feminine. They begin to play with kids of their own gender in activities identified with that gender. For example, a child may gravitate toward dolls and playing house. While another may play games that are more active and enjoy toy soldiers, blocks, and toy trucks.

[A policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2018/09/13/peds.2018-2162) encourages pediatricians to provide gender-affirmative care and talk with children and families about gender issues from young childhood through adolescence. The statement provides practical information for clinicians and encourages pediatricians to start conversations early.

This is why the proper course of treatment for children with gender dysphoria follows [the Dutch Method](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22455322) starting with a social, reversible, non-medical one—allowing a child to change pronouns, hairstyles, clothes, and a first name in everyday life.

The Dutch approach on clinical management of both prepubertal children under the age of 12 and adolescents starting at age 12 with gender dysphoria, starts with a thorough assessment of any vulnerable aspects of the youth's functioning or circumstances and, when necessary, appropriate intervention. In children with gender dysphoria only, the general recommendation is watchful waiting and carefully observing how the dysphoria develops in the first stages of puberty. Currently, withholding physical medical interventions in these cases seems more harmful to wellbeing in both adolescence and adulthood when compared to cases where physical medical interventions were provided.

[The American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.news10.com/news/national/doctors-group-recommends-support-for-transgender-children/1453236542) recommended support for kids who change their names or hairstyles to affirm their chosen gender identity.

Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Variant Individuals
(2012)  
 Being transgender gender or variant implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities; however, these individuals often experience discrimination due to a lack of civil rights protections for their gender identity or expression… Thus, this position statement is relevant to the APA because discrimination and lack of equal civil rights is damaging to the mental health of  transgender and gender variant individuals.  

**The American Psychiatric Association:**  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of transgender and gender variant individuals.  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that discriminate against transgender and gender variant individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against transgender and gender variant individuals in such areas as health care, employment, housing, public accommodation, education, and licensing.  
4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment, capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these individuals greater than that imposed on any other persons.

In a 2008 clarification, WPATH stated:

[S]ex reassignment, properly indicated and performed as provided by the Standards of Care, has proven to be beneficial and effective in the treatment of individuals with transsexualism, gender identity disorder, and/or gender dysphoria. Sex reassignment plays an undisputed role in contributing toward favorable outcomes, and comprises Real Life Experience, legal name and sex change on identity documents, as well as medically necessary hormone treatment, counseling, psychotherapy, and other medical procedures...


The medical procedures attendant to sex reassignment are not ‘cosmetic’ or ‘elective’ or for the mere convenience of the patient. These reconstructive procedures are not optional in any meaningful sense, but are understood to be medically necessary for the treatment of the diagnosed condition.

g5n4wsm,drewiepoodle,"There is no conceivable development path to literally have the mind of a polar bear, just like there is no development path for someone to literally be Napoleon or Lincoln. Believe in reincarnation if you want, but those things are fantasy/spiritual/religious and not really a matter of science and medicine.

It's even fine if you ""identify"" as another species, as in you feel some sort of inspiration or connection with them. That's harmless. But if you feel you're a polar bear and start wandering around naked on all fours and gnawing on people, then it's no longer harmless and it has entered into the realm of a dangerous delusion.

The primary explanation for trans people relates to how the brain develops. Depending on hormones and genetics in utero, the brain either develops along a masculine or feminine track. Nothing in biology is neat and clean. It's easy to understand that in some cases, things get mixed up a bit and you end up with a brain that is feminized in a masculine body, or a feminized brain in a masculine body.  There is not, however, any development path that could somehow give them the same structure that a male sheep would have. 

This is biology, not metaphysics. There's actual, real science behind this.

Trans people have the strong feeling, often from childhood onwards, of having been born the wrong sex. The possible psycho-genie or biological aetiology of gender dysphoria has been the subject of debate for many years. [A study showed that](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v378/n6552/abs/378068a0.html) the volume of the central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a brain area that is essential for sexual behavior, is larger in cis men than in cis women. A feminine-sized BSTc was found in male-to-female trans people. The size of the BSTc was not influenced by sex hormones in adulthood and was independent of sexual orientation. 

The study was one of the first to show a feminine brain structure in assigned male at birth trans people and supports the hypothesis that gender identity develops as a result of an interaction between the developing brain and sex hormones.

Here are a couple more studies that show that both sex and gender lies on a spectrum:-

[Gender Orientation: IS Conditions Within The TS Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3C4ZJ7HyuE)

People tend to define sex in a binary way — either wholly male or wholly female — based on physical appearance or by which sex chromosomes an individual carries. But while sex and gender may seem dichotomous, there are in reality many intermediates. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, people with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics than other men. In contrast, some people receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

People with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed female sexual characteristics than other women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since women with more than 90 per cent XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, women (XX) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia produced unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develop stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, men (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to male hormones and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

Even at the most basic physical level, there is a spectrum between male and female that often goes unrecognized and risks being obscured by stigma. 

A growing body of research is showing how biology influences gender expression, sexual orientation and gender identity — characteristics that can also fall outside of strict, socially defined categories. Toy-preference tests, a popular gauge of gender expression, have long shown that boys and girls will typically gravitate to toys that are stereotypically associated with their gender (cars and guns for boys, for instance, or plush toys for girls). While one might argue that this could be the by-product of a child’s environment — parental influence at play or an internalization of societal norms — Melissa Hines, a former UCLA researcher and current professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge, in England, has shown otherwise. In 2008, she demonstrated that monkeys showed the same sex-based toy preferences as humans — absent societal influence.

Sexual orientation (whether one tends to be attracted to men or women) has also been shown to have biological roots. Twin studies and genetic linkage studies have shown both hereditary patterns in homosexuality (attraction to one’s own sex), as well as genetic associations with specific parts of the genome. And while gender identity — the sense one has of oneself as being either male or female — has been harder to pinpoint from a biological standpoint, efforts to understand what role biology may play are ongoing.

 Understanding this complexity is critical; misperceptions can affect the health and civil liberties of those who fall outside perceived societal norms. Society has categorical views on what should define sex and gender, but the biological reality is just not there to support that.",worldnews,11,1600381663,
g5mtbyx,drewiepoodle,"The *American Psychiatric Association*, publisher of the DSM-5, has the following policy statement. ([Here's a copy](http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/MH/Documents/2013_04_AC_06d_APA_ps2012_Transgen_Disc.pdf))

""Therefore, the American Psychiatric Association:  
1. Supports laws that protect the civil rights of
transgender and gender variant individuals  
2. Urges the repeal of laws and policies that
discriminate against transgender and gender variant
individuals.  
3. Opposes all public and private discrimination against
transgender and gender variant individuals in such
areas as health care, employment, housing, public
accommodation, education, and licensing.  
**4. Declares that no burden of proof of such judgment,
capacity, or reliability shall be placed upon these
individuals greater than that imposed on any other
persons.**""


From the *American Psychological Association* :-

Is being transgender a mental disorder?

A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that **identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder**.

[Being transgender is no longer classified as a mental illness by the World Health Organization](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/06/20/transgender-not-mental-illness-world-health-organization/717758002/)",worldnews,6,1600376867,
g5mt2xd,drewiepoodle,"Science says otherwise. Trans people have the strong feeling, often from childhood onwards, of having been born the wrong sex. The possible psycho-genie or biological aetiology of transsexuality has been the subject of debate for many years, but the current medical consensus is that gender identity DOES actually include a major biological component. We have no idea what the details are (a gene, multiple genes, etc?) but we have pretty strong data that it's something durable and biological. 

Some brain studies do show differences associated with gender identity rather than with external body parts - [One study showed that](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v378/n6552/abs/378068a0.html) the volume of the central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a brain area that is essential for sexual behavior, is larger in cis assigned males(AMAB) than in cis assigned females(AFAB). A smaller-sized BSTc was found in AMAB trans people. The size of the BSTc was not influenced by sex hormones in adulthood and was independent of sexual orientation. 

The study was one of the first to show a smaller brain structure in AMAB trans people and supports the hypothesis that gender identity develops as a result of an interaction between the developing brain and sex hormones.

One researcher believes that it is due to intersex conditions within the trans person's brain:- [Gender Orientation: IS Conditions Within The TS Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3C4ZJ7HyuE)

Also, the attempts by the medical establishment to surgically change body parts of intersex children based on what seemed easiest surgically was not always in line with the person's actual gender. The thinking back then(and even today) was that gender identity was not biological. When the data was carefully collected, a majority of kids treated this way have a gender identity at odds with their surgically created body parts and upbringing(socialized as male/female). This is proof that we cannot change the gender identity someone already has innately.

People tend to define sex in a binary way — either wholly male or wholly female — based on physical appearance or by which sex chromosomes an individual carries. But while sex and gender may seem dichotomous, there are in reality many intermediates. Biological phenomena don’t necessarily fit into human-ordained binary categories. So while humans insist that you’re either male or female – that you have either XY or XX sex chromosomes – biology begs to differ.

For example, people with Klinefelter syndrome possess an extra X chromosome (XXY) or more rarely, two or three extra Xs (XXXY, XXXXY); they typically produce low levels of testosterone, leading to less-developed masculine sexual characteristics and more-developed feminine characteristics. In contrast, some people receive an extra Y chromosome (XYY) in the genetic lottery, and while they have been referred to as “supermales” that is more sensationalism than science.

People with Turner syndrome have only one X chromosome; they often display less-developed feminine sexual characteristics than other cis women. And people with a genetic mosaic possess XX chromosomes in some cells and XY in others. So how do we determine if they’re male or female? Hint: Don’t say that it depends on the chromosomal makeup of the majority of their cells, since cis women with more than 90% XY genetic material have given birth.

Even if you get the “right” combination of sex chromosomes, it’s no guarantee that you’ll fit into the carefully circumscribed human definitions of male and female.

For example, if you were born with two ""X"" chromosomes, but have congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the body produces unusually high levels of virilizing hormones in utero and develops stereotypically masculine sexual characteristics, including masculinized genitals.

Similarly, people born with XY chomosomes but have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome don’t respond to testosterone and fail to develop masculine sexual characteristics. Most live their lives as women. Some historians suggest that Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I and Wallis Simpson all suffered from this syndrome.

Even at the most basic physical level, there is a spectrum between male and female that often goes unrecognized and risks being obscured by stigma. 

A growing body of research is showing how biology influences gender expression, sexual orientation and gender identity — characteristics that can also fall outside of strict, socially defined categories.

Understanding this complexity is critical; misperceptions can affect the health and civil liberties of those who fall outside perceived societal norms. Society has categorical views on what should define sex and gender, but the biological reality is just not there to support that.

Here are a couple more studies that show that both sex and gender lie on a spectrum:-

g5mryyl,drewiepoodle,"&gt;Protections for things that don’t exist?

Wanna bet? We have examples going back to the Iron Age([article](https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium.MAGAZINE-ancient-civilization-in-iran-recognized-transgender-people-study-suggests-1.6790205)), and further back to the Copper Age([article](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/04/06/5000-year-old-transgender-skeleton-discovered/),[study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43858418?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)). Anthropologists have documented cultures around the world that acknowledge more than two genders.

Long before Cook’s arrival in Hawaii, a multiple gender tradition existed among the Kanaka Maoli indigenous society. The mahu could be biological males or females inhabiting a gender role somewhere between or encompassing both the masculine and feminine. Their social role is sacred as educators and promulgators of ancient traditions and rituals.

In pre-colonial Andean culture, the Incas worshipped the chuqui chinchay, a dual-gendered god. Third-gender ritual attendants or shamans performed sacred rituals to honor this god. The quariwarmi shamans wore androgynous clothing as “a visible sign of a third space that negotiated between the masculine and the feminine, the present and the past, the living and the dead.”

Prior to colonization, the Ankole people in what is now Uganda elected a woman to dress as a man and thereby become an oracle to the god Mukasa.

Among the Sakalavas of Madagaskar, little boys thought to have a feminine appearance were raised as girls. The Antandroy and Hova called their gender crossers sekrata who, like women, wore their hair long and in decorative knots, inserted silver coins in pierced ears, and wore many bracelets on their arms, wrists and ankles.

The indigenous Zapotec culture of Oaxaca is not divided by the usual dichotomies: gay or straight, male or female. There's a commonly accepted third category of mixed gender — people called muxes. (said to derive from mujer — Spanish for ""woman""). Some are men who live as women, or who identify beyond a single gender.

Fa'afafine are people who identify themselves as a third-gender in Samoa, American Samoa and the Samoan diaspora. A recognized gender identity/gender role since at least the early 20th century in Samoan society, and some theorize an integral part of traditional Samoan culture, fa'afafine are male at birth, and explicitly embody both masculine and feminine gender traits, fashioned in a way unique to this part of the world.

Indonesia recognizes a third gender, ""waria"". One ethnic group, the Bugis (numbering around 3 million people) recognize five genders. Their language offers five terms referencing various combinations of sex, gender and sexuality: makkunrai (“female women”), oroani (“male men”), calalai (“female men”), calabai (“male women”) and bissu (“transgender priests”). These definitions are not exact, but suffice.

In Pakistan and Bangladesh, the hijras are officially recognized as third gender by the government, being neither completely male nor female. In India also, transgender people have been given the status of third gender and are protected as per the law despite the social ostracism. The term more commonly advocated by social workers and transgender community members themselves is khwaja sira and can identify the individual as a transsexual person, transgender person (khusras), cross-dresser (zenanas) or eunuch (narnbans).

Kathoey or katoey refers to either a transgender woman or an effeminate gay male in Thailand. A significant number of Thais perceive kathoeys as belonging to a third gender, including many kathoeys themselves, while others see them as either a kind of man or a kind of woman. However, when considering transgender women (MtF) as a group in Thai society, most refer to themselves as phuying (""women""), with a minority referring to themselves as phuying praphet song (a ""second kind of woman"") and only very few referring to themselves as kathoey.

Anthropological research indicates well over 100 instances of diverse gender expression in Native American tribes at the time of early European contact. The most common modern term for the gender non-conforming members is ""Two Spirit"" (also two-spirit or twospirit) used by some indigenous North Americans to describe certain spiritual people - gay, lesbian, bisexual and gender-variant individuals - in their communities. The term was adopted in 1990 at an Indigenous lesbian and gay international gathering to encourage the replacement of the anthropological term berdache.

""Two Spirit"" is not interchangeable with ""LGBT Native American""; this title differs from most western, mainstream definitions of sexuality and gender identity in that it is not so much about whom one sleeps with, or how one personally identifies; rather, it is a sacred, spiritual and ceremonial role that is recognized and confirmed by the Elders of the Two Spirit's ceremonial community. While some have found the term a useful tool for intertribal organizing, not all Native cultures conceptualize gender or sexuality this way, and most tribes use names in their own languages. While some terms are not always appropriate or welcome, ""two spirit"" has generally received more acceptance and use than the term it replaced.

Individual tribes often also have their own classifications, there's the wíŋkte among the Lakota, the mixuga among the Ponca, the badé among the Crow, and many others. These are all third gender roles adopted by males, somewhat analogous to what we might think of as a transgender woman today. They're not exactly equivalent of course. In general, these third gender roles were liminal social positions, standing somewhere between the categories of Man and Woman - being neither, but having traits of both in addition to traits that are unique unto itself. 

The degree to which a third gender person could shift fluidly between Man, Woman, and Third Gender roles varied among cultures. Osh-Tisch, the most famous badé, for example generally adopted the attire of women and engaged in women's work, but when war came to the Crow, Osh-Tisch adopted men's clothing and fought with the men (earning the rather badass name Finds-Them-and-Kills-Them). Among the Crow of that time (late 1800s), Osh-Tisch's gender fluidity was considered less remarkable than the fact that a woman,The Other Magpie, also fought alongside Osh-Tisch. Like most badé, Osh-Tisch never married but did have at least one long-term relationship with a man and perhaps another with a woman (who may be The Other Magpie). When the US forced their own ideas of gender on the Crow, the people rallied in defense of the badé. Though Osh-Tisch was eventually forced by US agents to adopt what they deemed appropriate attire and labor for a man, the badé managed to keep many of the traditions associated with that gender role alive.

In Diné (Navajo) society, they traditionally have had five genders: female-in-woman (asdzaan), male-in-man (hastiin), nadleeh (like hermaphrodite or androgyny or gender fluidity), woman-in-man nadleehi (feminine gender), and then man-in-woman nadleeh (dilbah - masculine gender).

For the Navajo, it has less to do with sexual preference or biology than societal role. Most of the time, there was not much special about these people - they just were. Though society hierarchy meant that female-gendered individuals were more dominant (I guess that is the right word) because the feminine is the first gender. Nadleeh could be revered because they might express both male and female spirits perfectly, whereas every other gender could express only one spirit (it is with noting though that not every Nadleeh does, which is why sometimes people say ""at least” five genders - there is some wiggle room in there).

Even in the heart of Catholic Italy, in Naples, there is the centuries-old phenomenon of femminielli, those assigned male at birth who dress and behave as women. They are respected figures, traditionally believed to bring good luck, which may date back to pagan rituals of crossdressing, or eunuch priests.

This vast anthropological and archaeological evidence of multiple gender expression is often willfully ignored, but the reality is that gender non-conformity has been a part of human society since the very beginning, and it's not going anywhere.",worldnews,9,1600376359,

My aunt used to do a meditative excersise with me, basically going from my toes up talking about how heavy/relaxed each part of my body was. 

'You feel the warm weight moving from  your toes and it works its way up your legs' ect ect

It was a great relaxation technique and I was always asleep before she got to my head. 

 I never thought about until just the other night when my bf had mentioned how fucking fast I fall asleep. When we met i was going through a really rough time and it was the only time in my life sleep didn't come easy, so I would be awake listening to him sleep talk. I kinda miss that lol. 

Anyhow I think I had used that technique so often as a kid that I just do it thoughtlessly now as an adult. I mean when my body hits the bed I feel all my weight sink into it and *poof* off to lala land I go.

Difference is they b.f. has always let me mourn, lash out whatever. If he didn't, I wouldn't be with him. 

Difference is my b.f. would never grab even one of my LH old beer shirts without asking me and kids first

The issue is when OP's parents raided her education fund also provided by grandma.
Like you, I am not a fan of all of the stipulations, however, wanting your kids or grandkids to keep a ""clean"" life while pursuing an education is not an ultra-conservative or religious thing only.  There were no stipulations like ""no interracial or homosexual relationships"" or ""you must go to church/temple"" that were listed.  Yes I do live in the U.S. (after being born in Canada and spending half my childhood there) so maybe my liberal creds don't meet your expectations.

It seems like her conditions were to basically keep their noses clean and not do things that might jeopardize the opportunities provided by the education fund. Sure not getting publicly drunk (or smoking weed) seem a bit much but it was her grandchildren’s choice whether or not to accept the money and if they still really wanted to they could have stayed clean for the first couple of years and just paid their own way the rest of the way (or stay discreet and take the money anyway).",AmItheAsshole,4,1588792127,

g9ri6qq,DeceptiveFrost,"My take on this issue:

Support:

It’s due to the toxic side of LL again. People bashing some innocent YouTuber because of making an unpopular choice. Kind of like the Undertale community bashing Markiplier because he chose to do the Genocide Route first. Won’t be surprised that history would repeat itself. Armenti has been bullied by the toxic LL community multiple times, with the most notorious incident being the Rainbow Rat incident, where he won a RR, but was forced to release it. Running from such a sought after loomian would definitely trigger anyone, not going to lie about that part. Just imagine if someone started making a video of him running from Gammas and Gleam Roams. Armenti has stated his rationale behind running away from the HWDs, and it’s completely reasonable. I’ve seen many people charge more for their loomian because it has Armenti’s OT on it. And catching loomians is quite time consuming, and I will admit that I have in fact run from many roamings while hunting. It’s being efficient in hunting. The toxic side of LL will always find issues with the game and people who play it. After the Rainbow Twilat event I truly have experienced it. I did not win a Rainbow Twilat, but I’ve seen people literally calling the winners out because of they were ‘less active’. Point is that this is another case of Toxic LL community, nothing too new. Armenti’s rationales are reasonable too, though it might seem controversial. 

Opposition:

This was Armenti’s fault too, he should have known how people would react when posting this video. He even acknowledges it in the title of the video. He knows it’s going to trigger people, but he went ahead anyways. And yet he still wondered why did he get so much hate. If you decide to do something that will trigger people, expect hate naturally. I’ve taken a look at the comments section and it isn’t that bad as he phrased it to be. And he can’t blame people who don’t have a HWD for not spending time. I’ve once spent 8 hours during the Geklow event and the rarest thing I got was a Gold Geklow. No joke. People can have a really bad day of RNG sometimes. And not everyone can spend as much time as he does on LL. Based on his argument that people can spend as much time as him due to AM can be debunked easily. Most AM players are young. Like really young. My 6 year old sister only plays AM all day, and when I got her to play LL she said it was boring and quit after beating the first theatre. Not a lot of kids find running around a patch of grass for some digital creatures entertaining. AM is very different from LL. AM is VERY interactive, which is attractive to young kids. LL is less interactive, and hunting mainly consists of running in a patch of grass repetitively. A lot of kids are going to get bored unless they encounter something rare every 10 encounters. People will get bored by repetitive hunting, so people spending less time on LL is also due to the monotonous nature of hunting. AM is more interactive and offers something more than just running around in circles all day. Naturally young kids(which consists of majority of Roblox’s playerbase), would want to spend more time in AM than in LL.

Many old people die from the flu as well and coronavirus is similar, just more contagious and slightly more vicious, making it much more dangerous to them.

People definitely do die from coronavirus. And even if they don't die from a fucking fever or something that's directly caused by the virus, it can cause complications with other issues that a patient had going on which, without contracting the virus, would have continued without complication for much longer and the patient wouldn't have died. Especially not so soon. The virus complicates present issues and that's why old people are so vulnerable, they have a lot of ongoing health issues.

Clinton's not relevant to corona virus at all.

Which isn't your claim. You said 'a supreme court justice was appointed during an election year 29 times'. That has happened seven times. I listed them. You can check. Pulling this twenty-nine bullshit is entirely disingenuous, and it completely ignores the fact that plenty of new precedents have been set in the last century or so.

&gt;also I love how your even source acknowledges RGB was confirmed in an election year 

It doesn't, because she wasn't; she was nominated and confirmed in 1993 -- *as you well know*, because you cite it later in your comment -- which was not an election year. It wasn't even a midterm year. When it says 'there were 16 vacancies, including Ginsburg's, that occurred before Election Day during an election year', it's very obviously referring to the one left behind after her death, not the one she took over after Byron White retired.

2) The last time someone was confirmed in this situation was in 1956.

3) It happening this close to an election is *extremely* rare.

4) Any vacancy happening due to the death of a justice is *extremely* rare, especially in the modern era. Justices tend not die on the job; before Scalia in 2016 it was Rehnquist in 2005. Before that, it was Fred Vinson in 1953. It used to be much more common for justices to die on the job, but since the fifties most have chosen to retire instead, which means that they can (often) help to ensure that their successor is nominated by a President who they choose and which presents major ideological shifts.

5) None of which matters, of course, because if your line is that it's perfectly right and normal to appoint a justice in an election year, what was the justification for blocking the nomination last time?

The public generally has a short memory, and a stint on *Dancing with the Stars* will do a lot to rehabilitate someone in the public eye. She's certainly not the first person to use -- or attempt to use -- that as a way into the public's good graces. (See also: Rick Perry, Sean Spicer, Ryan Lochte, Tonya Harding, Tom DeLay, Floyd Mayweather, Andy Dick... the list goes on.) Add onto that that her choice of songs has been very much on-brand ('Eye of the Tiger', 'What's New Pussycat?', and 'The Circle of Life') in a way that appeals to a lot of people, she's lobbied for animal rights and has [recently come out as bisexual](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/10/19/carole-baskin-bisexual-lgbt-sexuality-big-cat-rescue-joe-exotic-tiger-king-aids-crisis-dancing-with-the-stars/), and it's easy to see why a fair amount of coverage of her recently has been positive.

It's also worth pointing out that, regardless of your beliefs about the [allegations about the disappearance of her first husband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Don_Lewis), Joe Exotic [*quite literally tried to have her murdered.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Exotic#Arrest,_conviction,_and_imprisonment) For all the speculation about Don Lewis, that much is just a fact. It's honestly astonishing that Carole Baskin ended up coming out of *Tiger King* the villain in people's minds anyway, and this may very well turn out to be just the backswing from the sheer amount of bile that was thrown her way in April. (Once the fuss of the show had died down, several commentators noted that the treatment of Baskin in the show [had an edge of misogyny to it](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/tiger-king-carole-baskin-joe-exotic-netflix-sexist-misogyny-don-lewis-a9438451.html), and given the pass that a lot of people gave Joe Exotic at the time, it's possible this is just a reconsideration of her portrayal in the light of additional information and time.)",OutOfTheLoop,13,1603586517,'probably the worst poster on this sub' - /u/Real_Mila_Kunis
g9ywo49,Portarossa,"If you're saying that there's justification for a criminal investigation 'depending on how far along she was in the pregnancy', then what you're saying is that the rights conferred by personhood only kick in at a certain point -- which is exactly the crux of the abortion debate. Whether that's at conception, or birth, or viability, or somewhere in between *is* the issue.

If it depends on how far along in the pregnancy you are, it's not an inalienable right. A toddler has the same right to life as a centenarian. There's no wiggle-room there. You can't say that killing one is more acceptable because of their age; in the eyes of the law, it carries the same penalty. Similarly, what do we ban as criminal negligence? Smoking and drinking and drug use seem natural choices... but what about elective amniocentesis, which can cause miscarriages at a rate of [more than one in a hundred prior to 15 weeks](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/amniocentesis/risks/)? What about a refusal to get treatment for mental health issues such as bulimia, which can impact the health of a foetus? What about working a 40 hour week, which can [increase a woman's risk of miscarriage by 38%](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pregnancy-shift-work-idUSKCN1UD32R)? Does that constitute criminal negligence too? What if I told you that [it increased the risk of miscarriage more than cigarette smoking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3969532/)? (Research shows that the risk of miscarriage increases with the amount smoked, with a 1% increase in relative risk per cigarette smoked per day -- or in other words, anything less than a pack a day and your job is likely to increase the risk of your miscarriage more than your addiction to cigarettes.)

Where do we draw the line? Well, that's what we try and do via laws. You say that when you bring legislation into the picture, you need to define it... but the law is, by its nature, imperfect. We're still figuring it out, but that means setting limits that are often fairly arbitrary. (It's legal, for example, to have an abortion at [24 weeks in Pennsylvania](https://www.businessinsider.com/latest-point-in-pregnancy-you-can-get-abortion-in-50-states-2019-5?r=US&amp;IR=T), but cross the border into Ohio and you're limited to 20 weeks, and cross in the other direction to New Jersey and there's no age limit. We can fairly safely say that *morally* abortion is the same in all three states, but the states have come to different legal distinctions based, one assumes, on different reasoning.) At what point does criminalising something do more harm than good?

You might not like it, but we live in precisely that sort of grey area, and we probably always will.",OutOfTheLoop,1,1603581742,'probably the worst poster on this sub' - /u/Real_Mila_Kunis
g9yrtqh,Portarossa,"&gt;The chart literally says that 28% of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in the second trimester...meaning that 72% do not believe that abortion should be legal in the second trimester.

That's... not what that means. At all.

Firstly, it completely ignores the 40% of Americans who didn't answer one of the three categories. You've lumped them all in as 'no abortions ever', but you can't just add them to whichever category best suits your narrative. That's a bit of statistical sleight of hand, and it's outright disingenuous.

Secondly, the gaps between the trimesters are pretty big. The second trimester runs from about 12 weeks to about 24 weeks. That's partly a problem with the methodology of the question, but I'd be willing to bet that the number of people who believe an abortion should be legal at 13 weeks and at 24 weeks is not accurately summed up by lumping them all in as 'second trimester'. (Consider, most states that set a restriction do so at 20 weeks.) Now that's not your fault -- you don't have access to that information -- but you're making an assessment as though you do, and that's not going to work.

Thirdly, and most importantly, you're completely ignoring the fact that the question asks whether it should *generally* be legal. As can be seen further down the story, there are plenty of *specific* situations in which people believe that abortion should be legal even in the third trimester, let alone the second. (Hell, 20% of respondents said that abortion should be legal when the woman does not want the child for *any reason* -- significantly more than the 13% who said abortion should generally be legal in the top graph.) That's disregarding the 75% of people who said a third-trimester abortion was acceptable when the woman's life is endangered, the 52% who agreed when the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest, the 48% who agreed when the child would be born with a life-threatening illness, and the 35% who agreed when the child would be born mentally disabled -- all of which would be enough to stop your hypothetical supermajority.

There is, as we can see, a pretty sizeable gap between 'a supermajority of Americans believe abortion should be illegal after the first trimester' and 'Americans have varying opinions on when abortion should be legal, but a majority of them say that abortion should be legal in some form until the third trimester, let alone the second'. Claiming the former from the data presented is just flat-out wrong.

g9yhnwz,Portarossa,"One could, but it would still be an extremely flawed argument.

Firstly, you'd have to figure out what you mean by an elective abortion. Normally, we say that's for reasons other than the health of the mother or foetal abormalities, but where do we draw the line? Does the mental health of the mother count? If a woman feels having a child will add to existing mental health issues, is that a compelling reason to justify an abortion, if she feels it will increase her risk of suicide?

Besides which, what's the risk to the physical health of the mother when it becomes acceptable? As any doctor will tell you, even the smoothest-sailing of pregnancies isn't a risk-free proposition. In America, there are about [18.8 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_mortality_in_the_United_States). Now on the one hand, that seems like a small number... but on the other, it's really not. That's about one in 5,300. At what point do we say the risk is high enough to justify it? One in a thousand? One in five hundred? One in twenty? Fifty-fifty? Remember, if you're legislating against a woman's right to choose, you have to decide the appropriate level. You're the one playing craps with someone else's life -- and no matter where you set the level, some of them will die.

Plus, to what extent are these inalienable rights a thing? Let's say abortion is murder (it isn't) and the foetus is equivalent in rights to a toddler (it isn't). I can't kill a toddler to save someone else's life... so why am I allowed to kill a foetus to save the life of the mother? I can't claim self-defence, any more than I could claim that killing someone to harvest their organs to save five people's lives should be legal. Does there need to be an investigation if I have a miscarriage? (Remember, 30-50% of fertilisations end [in what's known as 'spontaneous abortion'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage).) If not, why not? If so, where do we draw the line? There are, after all, [plenty of risk factors for miscarriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_risks). Do they all become grounds for criminal negligence?

Obviously I'm taking this to extremes, but the argument falls apart as soon as you look at it for longer than about thirty seconds. We do not treat foetuses the same way we treat children, because they're not the same. There's a fuzzy grey area in the middle, but don't let that distract you from the very real harm that overly-strict abortion legislation can cause.",OutOfTheLoop,2,1603576422,'probably the worst poster on this sub' - /u/Real_Mila_Kunis

g9xvd4r,Portarossa,"She, and I never claimed that.

There are a couple of things to break down here. Firstly, the obvious: if you're taking an at-conception stance, then a foetus in the first trimester is functionally equivalent to a foetus in the second trimester. As far as I'm concerned, at the point at which you try and separate out the two, you lose the right to take an exclusively pro-life stance. You believe in access to abortion with exceptions that go beyond just things that are relatively uncontentious, such as the life of the mother and foetal health issues; we're really just haggling about the timing at this point. If 60% of people believe in that and [46% of Americans call themselves pro-life](https://news.gallup.com/poll/313094/americans-abortion-views-steady-past-year.aspx) (and what a marketing coup *that* was), something's a little fucky. Everybody's *pro-life*. What they mean is that they're anti-abortion, except in specific cases that they think are acceptable, which plainly varies from person to person -- as it does with everyone. Most people aren't arguing that the line exists. We're arguing about where it is, when it is, and who gets to set it.

But I digress.

Secondly, what you should be taking from that graph is that as of 2018, 60% of Americans believe that abortion should be legal up until six or so months into a pregnancy. Consider what that actually means. The first trimester takes you up until about Week 12, by which point about 90% of abortions that will happen will have taken place. [Less than 1% of abortions in America happen at later than 20 weeks](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2019/mar/07/abortion-late-term-what-pregnancy-stage) (that's five months, if you're keeping count). Even by the start of the second trimester, the vast majority of women who are going to get an abortion will have done it. Those that happen later than that are not happening on a whim; they're happening because something has gone very, very wrong. As [Pete Buttigieg put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlHe6omKw3M):

&gt;So, let's put ourselves in the shoes of a woman in that situation. If it's that late in your pregnancy, that means almost by definition you've been expecting to carry it to term. We’re talking about women who have perhaps chosen the name, women who have purchased the crib, families that then get the most devastating medical news of their lifetime, something about the health or the life of the mother that forces them to make an impossible, unthinkable choice. That decision is not going to be made any better, medically or morally, because the government is dictating how that decision should be made.

He's right. Third trimester abortions -- those after Week 29 -- are only there in extremely limited circumstances; [the latest date allowed by all states (except West Virginia) is 24 weeks](https://www.businessinsider.com/latest-point-in-pregnancy-you-can-get-abortion-in-50-states-2019-5?r=US&amp;IR=T), except for a compelling external reason such as the life of the mother.

Because it needs to be stated: the vast majority of abortions happen early enough in pregnancy that the vast majority of Americans believe it is acceptable. It's not even close. What we're talking about are the edge cases -- which is a discussion that's important to have, because it impacts tens of thousands of women every year -- but it's disingenuous to use that as a reason to limit abortion access as a whole. When you have, for example, one abortion clinic in a whole state -- as is the case in [Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/29/health/six-states-with-1-abortion-clinic-map-trnd/index.html) -- you're not limiting access to those abortions you deem to be 'improper' because they're happening too late, or because you don't like the reasoning. You're limiting access to *all* abortions in that state.

And thirdly, if you're going to claim I'm intellectually dishonest, at least present what I'm saying correctly. I never said that the majority of any party supports the idea of abortion in all cases. The number of people who think you should be able to abort a foetus on a whim the day before you're due to give birth is so small as to be a complete red herring. It's a fraction of a percentage of a rounding error, and it's only ever used as a distraction by people who are trying to make the pro-choice crowd seem like people revelling in the joys of killing babies. (We're not. Spoilers.)

What *is* true is that the vast majority of Americans want there to be provisions for abortion access in America. They want those provisions to be extended beyond merely protecting the life of the mother. They do not want women to have to justify *why* they're getting an abortion, merely to know that -- at least up to a certain point in pregnancy -- it will be performed in a safe, clean and minimally invasive or traumatic manner.

Abortion sucks. No one gets excited at the thought that it might happen to them -- but the majority of people want to know that if it *is* a decision they choose (or are forced into by circumstances, whatever those circumstances may be) that their right to it is protected.",OutOfTheLoop,2,1603567095,'probably the worst poster on this sub' - /u/Real_Mila_Kunis

I mean, the idea that most people take a non-absolutist stance makes sense. That includes things like setting any sort of time limit on abortions, which most people are in favour of; there are plenty of ardent pro-choice activists who would concede that you probably shouldn't be able to get an abortion the day before you're due. On the other hand, being against abortion in a non-absolutist sense can go right up to 'absolutely not except in cases where the mother is in imminent danger of death'.

A lot of abortion law in the United States comes down to verdicts by the Supreme Court, the nine-person body that settles debates about (among other things) whether the laws made by Congress are constitutional.

One of the more liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, died in September aged 87, which left an open seat just before an election -- a very rare happening. (You can read more about that whole business [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/ivi5xf/whats_going_on_with_the_judge_who_died_and_why/g5ri7rd/).) Her almost-certain replacement is a woman named Amy Coney Barrett, who leans distinctly to the right. (It's worth noting that this is very much a divisive issue; [most Americans believe that the decision should be left until after the election](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-want-to-wait-until-after-the-election-to-fill-the-supreme-court-vacancy/), so that the winner in November can decide, but Republicans in the Senate are pushing it through quickly.)

There are significant concerns that Barrett would rule that cases like *Roe v. Wade* are unconstitutional, which would strip a lot of American women of access to abortion services. This has been happening already in many Republican-run states (As the *New York Times* put it: ['In a six-month period last year, states across the South and Midwest passed 58 abortion restrictions, including criminalizing abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, a time before many women are aware they are pregnant.'](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/20/us/abortion-supreme-court-trump-biden.html)), but an overturn from the Supreme Court would allow restrictions on a federal level; [39 Republican Senators recently signed an *amicus curiae* brief asking SCOTUS to consider overturning *Roe v. Wade*.

This is compounded by the fact that the Trump administration has [just signed an international declaration favour of women's health that specifically speaks out against governments using promoting abortion as a form of 'family planning'](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/22/us-trump-administration-signs-anti-abortion-declaration) and says 'the child [...] needs special safeguards and care [...] before as well as after birth'. This [Geneva Consensus Declaration](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/geneva-consensus-declaration-english.pdf) has been criticised not just for its content, but for who signed it. Among the thirty or so countries who joined the US are Brazil, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Uganda, Belarus, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Sudan, South Sudan and Libya -- not generally countries that have a stellar reputation for protecting women's rights. (The annual Georgetown University [Women Peace and Security Index](https://giwps.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/WPS-Index-2019-20-Report.pdf) ranks most of these countries low down the list, with many in bottom twenty; the USA is the only country that breaks the top twenty this year.)

While overall a majority of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases -- with 61% affirming *Roe v. Wade* -- [62% of Republicans and those who lean toward the Republican Party say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, but 82% of Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party say abortion should be legal in all or most cases](https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/). Additionally, 77% of Americans who describe themselves as Conservative Republicans believe it should be illegal in all or most cases.

Firstly, *it's not a left-wing worldview*. It's a facts-first worldview -- which, granted, [doesn't fit well with the current GOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracity_of_statements_by_Donald_Trump) -- but if you think I wouldn't hold the left wing to the same level of scrutiny, you're out of your damn mind. It's not about scoring points for one team or the other. It's about trying to provide verifiable information, and doing so in a way that people who previously may have struggled to find a way into a story can access it more easily. If most of the misinformation is coming from one side of the aisle, *of course* that's going to get called out more often. To do anything less would be pandering. That's *not* bias. I do my level best to make sure that nothing in my posts is just the presentation of my own personal opinion. That's why I go out of my way to source them, and why I spend so long responding to people's questions when they raise points about why I might have failed to include something. (Quite besides which, opinions are allowed outside of top-level comments, so there should be no problem no matter *what* I put in them -- but I *still* do my best to make sure that every statement is backed up by reliable sources.)

Secondly, I don't get a say in the rules on that sub. The mods can change them at any time. (In fact, I've turned down the opportunity to be a mod on that sub specifically *because* I don't want people to think that I'm getting unfair treatment or that I've stacked the deck in my favour.) What I want is the rules to be applied fairly and clearly and consistently. The mods have made it clear that discussion -- regardless of how one-sided it is -- is allowed on everything but top level comments. What you're suggesting is that it would be fine for me to put my long analysis on someone else's top level comment, but not on my own. As it stands, that's the line they've drawn, and I stick to it. I'll follow the rules, but I'm not going to follow rules that don't exist. The day the mods say that they're banning context posts like mine is the day I leave entirely -- because it's the day that the sub officially stops being about information and starts being about the *appearance* of information. So far, that's not the line they've drawn. That's why I stick around -- but yes, they don't get the TL;DR without the context. The context *is* the story. It's the whole point. It's the difference between journalism and public relations. My whole justification for putting so much extra effort into my posts is because I'm a big believer that you can't understand a story without looking at the world outside that narrow bubble: how we got to where we are, how it matches up with other historical events, how it might be more nuanced on the surface than it first appears. It's the reason newspapers write articles and not just headlines. You can't be fully informed without it. If you ask why I stick around rather than going my own way, *that's* why. OOTL is, pretty much by definition, a place where people who don't know something go to find out an answer. I keep going back because I don't want to just tell people who already know things. I want to explain things to people who *don't* have that background but are still eager to learn, and who trust me to give them reliable information. Sure, I could go somewhere else, but I want to have that back-and-forth discussion with people. OOTL is one of the best communities I've found for that, on balance.

Thirdly, if I have any more clout on that sub than anyone else, it's because I've bloody well earned it through my work. I've built up a reputation for trustworthiness and reliability by consistently putting the effort in. I didn't get a leg up from anyone. I don't have the mods pulling strings in my favour. I don't do anything that anyone else couldn't do. If I have a mouthpiece, it's because I've worked to earn the trust of the readers. I don't have the power to ban people who disagree with me (and if you've seen my inbox after a post like that, believe me, there are many who do). I can't delete other people's posts when they wilfully spread misinformation. The only tool I've got in my particular toolbox is the time and patience to explain things, and I'm not going to apologise for doing that. Private message or public post, I haven't said anything that I don't 100% stand by.

I have a lot of respect for the mods, and I've previously gone out of my way to defend them when they've been criticised. I understand that it's a pretty thankless task at times, and I think that the vast majority of people who put their time into modding the sub do so because they genuinely want it to be an informative place to hang around -- a place where people can *actually learn things*. (That's the reason I'm there too, after all.) That doesn't mean they should be immune to criticism, from me or anyone else. When you say things like 'Oh, but why don't you just go and do your own thing?', what you're really saying is that I should just cut and run and find somewhere where I can control the narrative and leave the misinformation and bothsidesism to run rampant. That's not how I roll -- nor should it be.

I respect the mods, and the work they do. I mean that sincerely. I'd just like to see my work respected in turn.

**Also, while we're on the topic:** the [Trump story about the flagpole isn't true](https://usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/10/20/fact-check-donald-trump-and-mar-lagos-fight-over-flagpole/5921390002/). Trump didn't build a thirty foot hill to get around the rule -- no such hill exists -- and the question wasn't about the height of the flagpole but about the size of the flag, limits on which were set by a local ordinance. He also tried -- unsuccessfully -- to sue the town for $25 million for repeatedly demanding that he remove the flag and pole which were against the rules as laid out. Rather than Trump suggesting he pay his $120,000 to veterans' charities, he haggled the fine down to $100,000, which he then paid to charity (even though the story itself as originally circulated includes Trump waving off $120,000 as 'chump change'). When people were spreading that story, they were doing so with the intention of making Trump look like an anti-establishment badass who'd do whatever he wanted; the story as originally spread ends with 'Lol... That's why we love the guy'.

Is it biased to point out that this story, which has been floating around the internet in a way designed to make people think Trump is great for sticking it to the man, is horseshit -- which, to clarify, it absolutely is?

What you're suggesting is that I can happily post any hot take on anyone else's top-level -- even without sources -- but I can't post it on my own because... reasons, I guess? That's nonsense. I can see why they want a just-the-facts run on the top level, which is why I try and provide that, but there's an opposition to providing any sort of context. (Context, after all, requires weighing things against each other. Once you start providing sources, you have to make a judgement call as to how reliable those sources are, especially in a world where misinformation is running rampant.)

The reason I say **safely out of the top-level** is because I refuse to scarlet-letter my own posts as being biased. They're *not* biased, in any meaningful sense; I don't set out to write a hit piece on any given topic, but I look at the evidence as fairly as I can and lay out an answer that doesn't always take a 'both sides are equally right' approach. Both sides are *not* equally right a lot of the time, and it's important to point that out. As I repeatedly say, it's not biased to point out that the sky is blue no matter if the other guy says it's yellow; splitting the difference and saying the sky is green doesn't help anyone either. When you have a White House that repeatedly just makes shit up, saying 'On the other hand, the President says...' just obfuscates the issue. Yes, the President says -- but [the President lies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veracity_of_statements_by_Donald_Trump). It's not a partisan position to point that out.

That's why I go to such lengths to source my posts. I want people to see that these are not just my opinions, and that they're based in something more than my personal preconceptions. I regularly write posts that say that any given political furore is overblown. (Hell, in this case I'm specifically pointing out that what's being said about Chris Pratt probably isn't true.) 

And yeah, that's exactly my point. They *can't* articulate a consistent rule set, but that's part and parcel of fairly running a sub. Believe me, I've been asking for *literally years* at this point to get some guidance that goes deeper than 'we know it when we see it', which isn't a helpful stance -- and definitely isn't conducive to people spending hours researching answers. I would love it if they'd come out and explain to me what makes what I write biased. I've asked for any of the mods to just drop me a message next time a post gets removed, which happens about one in two times. Not one of them has ever done it, not even as a friendly courtesy to someone who -- let's be honest -- puts a *lot* of effort into making that sub a pleasant and informative place to be. I've built up a bit of a following from people who, I hope, respect my integrity and realise what I'm trying to do. It's a shame the mods don't, but that doesn't mean I'm doing to just roll over and pretend I was wrong all along.

I don't have anything against the mods as people, and I get that modding is a difficult and often thankless task. I do object to how they pander to misinformation. There are certain groups that have learned that they can suppress any facts they don't like by appealing to this bullshit both-sides narrative *regardless of reality*, and it's extremely disappointing that they keep falling for it.",bestof,1,1603216554,

(Besides, the novel is set in 1940, before ingredients really began to feel the pinch and things like 'ration chocolate' were invented. Lewis had experienced rationing of sweets -- sweet rationing lasted until 1953 -- but Edmund hadn't, which makes it a little anachronistic.) Other sweets were definitely around, and even though Edmund [is only ten when the book starts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Pevensie), that means he's had a decade of ration-free confectionary to draw on.

That still doesn't explain why Lewis specific chose Turkish Delight as his example of a candy that was so mindblowing you'd betray everyone you knew to get your hands on it. In both the book and the movie, Edmund [*actually chooses it*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhrdSylKQ-Q). Remember, he's specifically told he can have anything he wants, and *that's* what he settles on.

&gt;“It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating,” said the Queen presently. “What would you like best to eat?”  
“Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty,” said Edmund.  
The Queen let another drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared a round box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious. He was quite warm now, and very comfortable.

It's not like Jadis pulls out a box and he has some because any candy -- even Turkish Delight -- is better than no candy at all. He *chooses* it.

Now sure, I get it; it comes down to personal preference. There's actually [a pretty interesting article about *why* Turkish Delight might have been chosen](https://daily.jstor.org/turkish-delight/) -- basically, it has simple ingredients but was complicated enough to make that Europeans never quite got it just right, leading to it being imported from Turkey at significant expense if you wanted the good stuff; it was also (and as a result) often associated with Christmas for a lot of people -- but still.

The thing is, personal beliefs aren't personal -- doubly so when it comes to the ballot box.

If you're not working against a system that's actively harmful, there's a case to be made that you're propping it up.

Now imagine if you're a member of the LGBT community, and someone came out with evidence that someone whose work you admired was pushing to (for example) remove your right to get married. Is it not at least feasible that you might not be comfortable supporting that person? Is it wrong to be disappointed in them? Is it wrong to want to find out more about their views? Does the fact that they believe it privately rather than publicly really make it better, or stop it being harmful to you?

It's a combination of a bunch of things. It's not as though Chris Pratt has ever come right out and said 'Trump's my guy' or been cavorting around LA in a MAGA hat, but there are indications from a number of sources that his politics might lean Republican. (In a contentious election -- now only two weeks away -- that's become a sticking point for a lot of people. For many people, continuing to support the Republican Party in its current form, whether in public or in private, is a bridge too far; it can be seen as an endorsement of the status quo, which for many people is problematic in terms of supporting him.)

That said, we can look at the evidence for some of the more widespread claims. (*Sourcing takes time; treat this as a work in progress while this dislaimer is up, please.*)

#Chris Pratt is a Trump supporter.

*Possibly.* It's hard to say with any surety, because Pratt has made a studious point of not revealing his political affiliation. However, one of the biggest recent criticisms of Pratt is that when [the rest of the cast of the MCU got together for a Biden fundraiser](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/avengers-cast-joe-biden-fundraiser-1234808804/), Pratt was nowhere to be seen. He might not be vocally stumping for Trump in the way that [some celebrities are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign_endorsements#Celebrities,_producers,_and_musicians), but his absence definitely raised questions. Until he gives an endorsement either way -- which feels pretty unlikely at this point -- it can only really be speculative.

#Chris Pratt is a Republican.

*Significantly more likely.* He's been spotted wearing iconography that's often -- but not exclusively -- associated with the right wing, like the [Gadsen flag](https://twitter.com/hunteryharris/status/1150866021147906055). (For some people it's just a colonial era meme, but as the *New Yorker* has pointed out, it's increasingly being co-opted by the right, [including by white supremacist groups.](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-shifting-symbolism-of-the-gadsden-flag)) He's also married to Katherine Schwarzenegger, daughter of former Republican Governor of California (and I think he was in some movies or something?) Arnold. It's worth pointing out that both Katherine and Arnold Schwarzenegger have openly come out in favour of Biden this year, they're still Republicans; the 'Republicans for Biden' trope has been the topic of a lot of attention. Even if Pratt *is* supporting Biden this year -- or if he doesn't actively support Trump -- that wouldn't preclude him from being a Republican in general.

However, he's certainly claimed a more [centrist perspective](https://people.com/celebrity/chris-pratt-says-he-wants-to-help-bridge-political-division-i-dont-feel-we-have-to-be-at-war-with-each-other/) in the past:

&gt;'I really feel there’s common ground out there that’s missed because we focus on the things that separate us,' he said. 'You’re either the red state or the blue state, the left or the right.

It was just this sea of lights. I sat on a stile with half a bottle of wine that you could use to clean a submarine, and just... sat there, watching. It was a sense of peace that I'd never known before and have never known since.

When I got back to the party it turned out that someone had accidentally ripped the bathroom door off its hinges and a big fight had broken out because someone had (*allegedly*) given a blowjob in the garden to someone else's boyfriend, but that hour or so in that field was one of my most blissful memories.",AskReddit,1,1602942176,

g90wcah,Portarossa,"Firstly, please spare me the 'political leanings lately of universities' nonsense. Higher education is not some anti-conservative scam. If people who actually spend the time to understand these philosophies don't buy into them, there's at least a fair chance that it has less to do with some sort of leftist indoctrination and more to do with the fact that they completely fall apart if you look at them for longer than five minutes. You should at least give people the benefit of the doubt that if they've built careers on understanding these things, they might actually understand them.

But sure, let's take a bit of a deeper look. We'll start with a minor point about the idea of risk:

&gt;Capitalism allows for those who hire others to skim off the top, as you say, because **those who hire other people are the ones taking a risk** in business.

I'd argue that that's a limited view. Are they taking a risk? Capital, yes, but the implication that the workers aren't taking a risk -- often a greater risk -- is a bit rich. If I run a logging firm or a trawler fishing fleet or even a delivery service, I'm not the one who's going to be hit by a tree or smushed by a car. The workers are definitely taking risks in a physical sense, and they're taking financial risks as well: what happens if the company goes under? Could they make more by working for a competitor? What if they give their life to a company only to be fired just before they're eligible to retire? The notion that those who run the companies are the only ones taking risks is one that is put out by -- you guessed it -- the people running the companies. They do have somewhat of a vested interest -- and they use it, whenever the question of raising taxes or increasing regulation comes up. ('You can't raise taxes on us or make us provide safety equipment,' they say, 'because if we had to make 10% profit rather than 12%, we'd have to lay off all our workers... and you wouldn't want that, would you?' The notion that they could merely *make less money* doesn't seem to cross their minds. It's a form of economic hostage-taking, nothing more or less.)

But even that's largely irrelevant. We're not talking about the flaws of capitalism, we're talking about the flaws of Objectivism. How could a system that promotes individual responsibility be bad? Well, because that isn't all it promotes -- and the way it does is extremely short on nuance.

Personal responsibility *isn't* a bad thing. The expectation that personal responsibility is the only thing of value is very much a bad thing. The notion of absolute self-interest is a bad thing, because no such world exists. (If it did, it would be a fuckin' nightmare. It goes even beyond the libertarian ideal that you can do whatever you want as long as it doesn't harm anyone else; for an Objectivist, you can do whatever you want no matter how much harm it causes to others, because your-self interest is the only thing that matters. If you're strong enough or smart enough or rich enough to bend the system to your will, who gives a shit about anyone else?) The big criticism of Objectivism is that it's fundamentally an absolutist philosophy. There's no middle ground with it. Either you're acting in a way that makes you happy, or you're being irrational -- and in Rand's own words, that was the one thing she had no time for. ('I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism, but of reason.')

&gt;There are bad parts of capitalism, **if left to run amok**, but capitalism and individualism have driven much of our advances (in life outcomes, not socially)

Now sure, you can believe that, and I probably wouldn't fight you on all the way. There have been good things that come out of capitalism. (I would argue, and I hope you would agree, that there are good things to come out of collectivism too.)

However, what Rand proposes in Objectivism *is* capitalism run amok. Literally. That's not an exaggeration or a misreading; she was a massive proponent of what's called [*laissez-faire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire#Capitalism) capitalism, where government's job was to keep its nose out and ensure that the 'free market' could do its things. No rules. No regulations. No welfare. Nothing. (In *The Virtue of Selfishness*, she specifically writes: 'When I say “capitalism,” I mean a full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism—with a separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church.') Rand wanted a version of capitalism that was completely without restraint. Do you see where the problem lies?

To reiterate: you can't have an Objectivist philosophy that uses laws to limit capitalism in any way, even for the good of everyone who's not at the very top of the heap. The minute you have laws that suggest a minimum wage, or maximum working hours, or that you can't send children up chimneys or into dangerous factory conditions, or that your boss has to provide you with safety equipment, or that you can sue a doctor for medical malpractice if he leaves a scalpel inside of you, or that private companies aren't allowed to put mercury into the drinking water, or *any of those things*, you're acting contrary to Objectivist philosophy. It's not an edge case. It's an unavoidable part of it -- a feature, not a bug.

Capitalism has its flaws as a system -- and *boy, does it ever* -- but even my little leftist heart will admit that there are versions of capitalism that don't cause as much harm as others. Objectivism amplifies those flaws to the extent that it becomes immediately unworkable. We might -- and I suspect we *would* -- disagree on what extent a government should tax its citizens and provide services from that, but I think we'd probably agree that the answer isn't 'not at all'. There's value in being able to provide a military, a police force, a fire department, at least some education and at least some healthcare, and those cannot be provided for in a charitable fashion. (What happens if the billionaires insist on special treatment? What if they decided not to chip in one year? What does a police force look like in a world where Jeff Bezos provides their operating budget -- and what happens if they catch him speeding?) Even the *slightest* consideration of it as an actual, real-world philosophy makes it fall apart.

When you condense it down to 'But are you saying that personal responsibility is bad?', what you're doing is glossing over vast amounts of bullshit to make a point that no one is disagreeing with. Personal responsibility is great, but personal responsibility with a reliable safety net for those times when it all goes tits up is even better.",books,2,1602871378,

g9027ok,Portarossa,"Not quite. Her argument is that you have no obligation to look after other people at all if you don't want to. Sure, you *can*, if you choose to -- but if you want to be selfish (or wholly self-interested, if you want to take a *marginally* less-loaded term), you're perfectly within your rights to do that. As she put it, the point of Objectivism is 'the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.'

Now on the surface, this sounds great! After all, we can all acknowledge that those who work hardest should reap the rewards of their labour, and you shouldn't be forced to go hungry just to help feed someone else -- especially if that person is able to work but chooses not to. The problem is that when you put your own happiness as the moral purpose of your life -- that you put your own needs first in all cases -- then it becomes acceptable to do anything you want, *regardless* of whether it makes anyone else miserable, as long as it keeps you happy.

Consider it this way. If you're about to step out into the road and a truck is bearing down on you, I -- as an (entirely hypothetical) Objectivist -- have no moral obligation to leap into the road to push you out of harm's way and put myself in the path of the truck myself. (I think we'd all agree on that. It would be a brave and heroic act, sure, but I don't have to put myself in harm's way.) By the same logic, I have no moral obligation to take any risk at all to help save you. I don't have the moral obligation to run up to you, grab you arm and pull you back. I don't have the moral obligation to shout to get your attention. Hell, I don't have the moral obligation to do anything except walk on by and watch you get splattered -- because if I'm indifferent to your suffering (which I'm allowed to be), then anything that puts me out or lessens my own happiness (even if it's as simple as making me thirty seconds late for brunch) is acting contrary to the way things *should be*. Moreover, no one is allowed to give me any shit for that decision, because I'm acting in a way that is *morally right*, according to Objectivism. I'm allowed to weigh even the slightest inconvenience to me against the most amount of suffering for you, because... well, you know. Fuck you, Jack, I've got mine.

And you can see this echoed in other ways too. Jeff Bezos is worth something coming up on $200 billion at the moment. Jeff Bezos has more money than could ever reasonably be spent on luxury by a human being. He could lose a billion dollars in his couch cushions and it would affect his life in not even the slightest mote. Does he have a moral obligation to use some of that money -- money that, to clarify, he will not in *any way* notice the absence of; it's the equivalent of shouting to get the attention of someone about to get beaned by a semi -- to do some good in the world? An Objectivist would say no, he has no such obligation. He may *choose* to, but even choosing to isn't virtuous. It just *is*. The only goal is his own happiness. If helping others makes him happy, he can set up a foundation or just give out wads of cash on the street; if it doesn't... well, fuck you, Jack, Jeff's got his. He earned it, after all. (Even the argument that he worked for the money and he should be allowed to keep it all is flawed; [the whole *point* of capitalism is that it allows for people to hire other people to work for a living and for 'capitalists' to skim a little off the top for their trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1jJXfufMzc). But for the moment, let's assume that he earned every red cent from the sweat of his own brow, which he *definitely* did not.)

But you can expand that further. Can we justify taxes? For an Objectivist, no; you worked for it -- or you skimmed profit from other people working for it -- and so that money belongs to you. Does it matter that rich people will have marginal gains on their quality of life while the poor die from lack of healthcare? No, fuck 'em; my own happiness is the moral purpose of my life, and anything else is irrelevant. Does it matter that for a small amount of inconvenience to some individuals, you could provide roads, healthcare, education, clean air? (Yes, you're allowed to fuck up the environment freely as an Objectivist; her views on it were [pretty intense](https://www.ontheissues.org/celeb/Ayn_Rand_Environment.htm), let's say. Any attempt to limit that? Well, that's collectivism, and that's bad. As she's [often paraphrased](https://ari.aynrand.org/the-quotable-ayn-rand-who-is-going-to-stop-me/) as saying: 'The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.') Even more than that, once you've *got* that power, you don't have to acknowledge the privileges that come along with it. If you're a billionaire because your father left you a lump of cash, and he was a billionaire because *his* father left you a lump of cash, so on and so on up the tree, none of that matters. It's yours now, albeit by an accident of birth. Both you and Bezos can lobby politicians to stop like unions or labour laws, to prevent people from rising up and improving *their* lot in life. (Funnily enough, despite the fact that this would also fall under the category of 'people acting in their own interests', Rand isn't big on unions. It's fine if you do it for yourself, but if you work together, that's collectivism, and collectivism is *very bad*.) Once you've gone up a level, you're allowed to pull the ladder up behind you. It's up to those poor sods to make their own ladders, and never mind the headstart you might have got.

And so that's it in a nutshell. What Objectivism says is that if you have any level of power or privilege, you are protected from *any* effort to give up *any* of that power or privilege. You can go to *any* length to keep it. The only morality is what makes you happy, and if having power or privilege is what makes you happy?

(Although I think that's one route that lawyers who wanted to push it could take, unless you want to argue that squatting on [reddit.com/u/trademarkedusername](https://reddit.com/u/me) is materially different to squatting on trademarkedusername.com, which might not be such an easy sell; after all, could I legally take on something like BurgerKing.wix.com? Where's the line?). The law is -- as is *so often the case* with internet stuff -- still pretty much untested on that score. The reason I brought it up was because you confidently pointed out that 'It exists to ensure products from Company A can't be confused for products from Company B where the products are similar, nothing more', which is not in any way true. There are usage rights for trademarked properties -- like parody -- but you can't just go ahead and do what you like as long as you're not selling things, and holders of trademarks do have some legal recourse. (It also *doesn't* only exist to punish people who are planning to extort money from the holders, but that's by the by.)

If your objection is the ACPA, there are broader restrictions in the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006, which states that 'Subject to the principles of equity, the owner of a famous mark that is distinctive, inherently or through acquired distinctiveness, shall be entitled to an injunction against another person who, at any time after the owner’s mark has become famous, commences use of a mark or trade name in commerce that is likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment of the famous mark, regardless of the presence or absence of actual or likely confusion, of competition, or of actual economic injury.' Now, could you reasonably conclude that this counted as *use in commerce*? I don't know; I'm not a lawyer, but if I found myself in Burger King's shoes and someone was using a Burger-King-titled account on social media to say things that were likely to ruin the good name of my dining establishment ('dilution by tarnishment'), I'd definitely want to make a case for it. Would it work? It's hard to say. As I pointed out with my example of an Instagram user who managed to leverage their account for profit, the notion of what does and does not constitute 'commercial use' isn't as cut-and-dried as you seem to want to believe.

Also, you say that we're discussing the claim:

&gt;They own the trademark, so legally, they should be entitled to use the name [on Reddit].

That's not what I'm saying. My argument is:

&gt;They own the trademark, so legally, they should be entitled to stop *someone else* using the name [on Reddit].

That, I think there's a much stronger case for. No one would argue Reddit was in the wrong if they said no one got to use that account. Whether Reddit can (or should) allow *someone else* to use that account to do whatever they like is... trickier. Do they have to wait until the user uses it for purposes that are *definitely* commercial? Can a rival burger chain squat on that username and post bullshit all the live-long day? Are they legally obliged to remove that username under trademark law? It's hard to tell, but the fact that they generally *do* block people from having accounts like that should be a pretty strong indication that they think there's a case somewhere to be made. You're asking for it to be settled case law, but that's not how it works. Until there's a precedent set -- which would require a company to decide it was worth the fight -- there's not really a lot we can do about cases like these. It's dealt with on a case by case basis depending on how much liability companies want to risk. I'd agree that you don't have the right to use the name yourself, but you may very well -- and I'd argue you probably *do*, in a lot of cases -- have the right to stop someone else using it.

Reddit, in this case, has technically trafficked in something that is trademarked. If BK wanted to cause a fuss about it, my guess is that particular piece of legislation would be how their lawyers would go about it. (You can read the rules about what makes a bad-faith argument [here](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-106publ113/pdf/PLAW-106publ113.pdf), on page 583.)

Besides, we're not talking about 'a case where a company successfully used trademark law to assume control of a username or account name on a social media website'. We're talking about whether Reddit might reasonably decide that, rather than get the lawyers involved, they might use their power as a private company to reject a username (that, remember, the username holder has no inherent right to in their Terms and Conditions); whether they hand it over to the company in question after the fact is a different issue entirely. In this case, it appears they did. Could they have chosen to fight it? Sure, maybe; they might even have won. It's a legal grey area. Is it worth the hassle? Apparently not.

You might not like it, but your understanding of the mechanics of why this might have happened seems... kind of shaky.",TheoryOfReddit,1,1602592709,

It *is* a violation of the normal process. The GOP set a new normal in 2016 with Merrick Garland. Now they've decided they want it both ways, and they'll still whine like petulant little babies whenever the Democrats finally -- hopefully -- start treating the rules the same way.

All that really plays into why I'm anti-natal.

Like this six month old baby who would refuse to be held by anyone but me, always napped on my shoulder. I love kids and prior to my journey out of religion and through my mental health issues, It was a big dream of mine to get married and have a family. 

The closest I will ever come to having human children is adoption. But even with that, there's a ton of financial commitments that given my condition, I wouldn't be able to handle. The closest I'll ever have to a family is my dog.

Pretty sure that covers the list. 

They don't quite seem to understand why it's been hard for me to have success in school, find and keep jobs, etc. They're well in the ""Just pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" crowd. My mother has on several occasions accused me of wanting to just be on disability and not do anything with my life, as if I asked for this. They also raised me in a rather fundamental Christian cult that taught me so many things wrong about the world, I developed all kinds of issues and my mental health issues were just further exacerbated by it all. 

Anyway, I definitely did not ask for any of this and didn't want any of it. 

My dad has been incredibly successful in his career and life. My younger brother got the intelligence but also he's really tall, naturally athletic, and as far as I can tell is neurotypical. He's on track to become a pediatrician and will be getting married to his girlfriend of several years. And here's me, slogging my way through school, unable to find a job (even pre-pandemic I was unemployed for nearly two years), and I can't even be fully independent.

Because everything that is the state is a public matter and the people either directly or through elected representatives, have a say in how the state looks and runs. Ideally anyway. 

It's like they're trying to separate a Republic from democracy which is just stupid. They're scared of having things be MORE democratic (like removing the electoral college and just having the president be decided by popular vote), because they know that without the electoral college the democrats would sweep everything. Which would be much better for the country because it would force any competing parties to develop stronger, better platforms and even venture into coalition governments which would force the country to become more moderate instead of the far right it is right now.

g88qm2g,Romainvicta476,"You've also got to keep in mind that this season is happening in the middle of a pandemic, that might be weighing on him pretty hard too. But that's actually a good point. 

When CEH was drafted, I wasn't exactly happy. We needed offensive line help. But worst of all we needed a DB or LB and we spent our top pick on a RB when we were already fine at that position? The idea of CEH becoming the next Brian Westbrook was tantalizing but it's raised some concerns. 

Watching our offense these past few games, it looks to me like we are flip flopping between playing like we have Alex Smith at QB again and then like we have Mahomes at QB. 

Even if one doesn't pay attention to advanced analytics, it's clear that the way to win is to throw the ball. So why, when we have one of the best QBs to ever play the game, are we running so much? Analytics suggests that running on 1st down is fine. But beyond that you save it for 3rd and short, 4th and short, and goal line situations. The Chiefs aren't doing that. They've been a little too run heavy. 

CEH has more then demonstrated the talent that the coaching staff saw in him. Granted, he's playing with Mahomes, but he definitely is an excellent target for pass catching out of the backfield. But that's what it should be primarily is catching passes and not running. 

The Chiefs have got to return to the game planning mindset they used in the Superbowl run, but add in an explosive backfield pass catcher. Don't treat the offense like Alex Smith is under center. Treat it like Mahomes is under center.",KansasCityChiefs,1,1602269246,

g87ib4p,Romainvicta476,"It's hard to nail down an answer honestly. Prior to the Superbowl win, I'd have stuck to Rodgers as the most clutch but I'm not convinced of that anymore. Rodgers, while declining in recent seasons, is still a damn good QB and he has pulled out some performances where you just are befuddled by how he does it. 

But, in the time that Mahomes has been starting, only one of Mahomes and Rodgers clutched their team to consecutive comeback wins culminating in a Superbowl victory. 

Wilson is a bit different. When the play calling isn't stupid he looks like a football god. Again, in the time frame of Mahomes being a starter, only one of the two QBs pulled their team to consecutive comeback wins culminating in a Superbowl win. 

Based on the time frame of when Mahomes has been a starter, it's abundantly clear that Mahomes is the superior pick at QB. Year one as a starter he won NFL MVP and was one botched defensive play away from a Superbowl. Year two he missed two games, still was in the running for NFL MVP, and pulled his team to come from behind playoff wins and nailed Superbowl MVP. 

Rodgers did not do that in his first two years as a starter. 2008 the Packers went 6-10 and in 2009, they lost the Wildcard round game. It wouldn't be until later on that Rodgers would win NFL MVP and Superbowl MVP nods. 

2012 saw Wilson's team get eliminated in the Divisional round but win the Superbowl in 2013. Wilson hasn't won NFL MVP nor Superbowl MVP. 

Again, based on the sample sizes of the first two years as starters, Mahomes is far and away the best of them. But it's also discounting the longer careers the other two have had which doesn't quite feel right to me. I'd say that if we consider everything, Mahomes has an advantage in the conversation, but it's not quite so cut and dry.",KansasCityChiefs,1,1602244798,

But at my last command, that wasn't the case. Missing work occasionally so I could (as a friend overheard from our chief) to ""get in touch with my feelings or some bullshit"" was highly discouraged, even if they couldn't stop me. 

On the whole, there needs to be a massive shift in understanding what that help actually provides to sailors. I think  a significant portion of leaders pay lip service to getting help, but they don't actually understand what that help is, and the kind of effect it can have. 

I think if leadership sat down with people who provide these services to actually understand the process of helping people unburden and heal themselves. 

As for your command, I wish I had an answer. The reality is that most commands (in my opinion) won't give a damn about it until it happens to someone they know or someone in the command.

Thanks so much for your question and for being willing to engage in this conversation. If you are a progressive, we need you on Team Biden. We need everyone. The task - defeating President Trump in November - is too big and too important for us to do without you. I think the contrast between President Trump and Vice President Biden is profound, but if you are a progressive person there are a lot of reasons to vote FOR Biden, not just against Trump.

In my opinion, Biden’s agenda - when accomplished - will be looked upon by history as the most progressive agenda of any modern president. He is proposing a climate agenda that is bolder than anything we’ve seen before: a plan to achieve universal health care (more on that later); an agenda that will give unions the best friend they’ve ever had in the White House; a plan to give everyone an educational pathway to the middle class, whether that be free community and job training (which will be free for all under Biden’s plan) or a four-year degree (tuition-free for families making under $125,000 under Biden’s plan); a serious plan to take on gun manufacturers, starting by repealing the law excusing them of liability; and more.

And here’s the second point - Biden WILL accomplish this agenda. He is principled and tireless. He has a clear vision. He has experience as VP, so he knows how to move the levers of the executive branch to get stuff done. He also has experience as a Senator, so he has strong relationships with many members of Congress and knows how to go up to the Hill and secure the final votes needed to get critical legislation passed (in 2009, he went to the Hill to secure the final three votes needed to pass the Recovery Act).

Biden will most importantly always listen and always create room at the table for progressives (and people from across the political spectrum). I want to take a moment to talk about the specific issue you raised - health care. As VP Biden has said, for him health care is personal. And he will fight for your family’s health care as if it were his own. You are right that VP Biden does not support Medicare for All. I don’t know you, but I do think you and VP Biden might share the same goal: achieve universal health care and lower health care costs. I really do think Biden has proposed the quickest, most effective way to get there - by creating a new public option that everyone can choose (even if you have employer-based care today). Under the Biden plan, everyone will get to choose between this new public option or the private plan they have today. Biden will also lower health care costs by increasing premium subsidies and making sure people can afford plans with lower deductibles and out-of-pocket spending. And, he will take on pharma to lower prescription drug costs.

But none of that happens if Biden doesn’t beat Trump.

I grew up committed to public service thanks to my mom. In high school, I became really upset when the local city council passed a cruel anti-panhandling ordinance. At that moment, I decided I wanted to help change the laws and go work in Washington (in retrospect, I should have considered local/state government more seriously but I was young! I really think state and local government is more impactful than people realize). I went to Duke to study at their public policy school for undergrad, still hoping to go work in Washington. I didn’t know anyone in Washington, so I googled bios for people I thought had the types of careers I wanted and it seemed like they all went to law school. I applied to law school and was about to go, when a very wise teacher told me to just take one year off. A classmate of mine had done the White House Internship Program a year earlier. I didn’t know that was a thing you can actually get without connections! But thanks to her inspiration, I applied to the White House Internship Program, was accepted, and was placed in VP Biden’s policy office. Long story short I basically stayed until they had to hire me, and then I stayed for 5 years. I did finally make it to law school, but once Trump won and VP Biden asked me to help him set up the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware, I returned to Team Biden and finished up law school remotely.

I have pretty much only worked for VP Biden for the past ten years because I believe in him. I believe in his character and vision. And I am so excited to do everything I can to help him beat President Trump in November.

If you want to get involved and don’t know how, I would like to propose two things. First, take a look at joebiden.com/action. We have programs where you can call and text potential voters from your couch. You don’t have to have any experience! Our team gives you advice regarding what to say and talks you through the entire process. Second, don’t underestimate the power of your voice in your networks. Think about the people you interact with. Family, friends, neighbors, co-workers - everyone you interact with. My guess is that you sharing with them why you are voting for Joe, and asking them whether they are registered and have a plan to vote (and then helping them navigate iwillvote.com), will have a real impact.

Thank you so much for your support and energy. 34 days to go!",politics,1,1601490546,
g774xpo,StefFeldman,"I think this question is getting at rulemaking versus legislation, which is a very important question. As we’ve seen with President Trump, it is fairly easy for a president to undo a rule put in place by a prior Administration. It is much harder for the president to rally Congress to overturn a law.

Biden definitely believes in using both legislation and rulemaking to get things done. My personal view is that if legislation is achievable, it is a preferable pathway for exactly the reason discussed above.

The good news is that I have great faith in Biden’s ability to get legislation passed. He has longstanding relationships with many members of Congress, has experience going up to the Hill to get the needed votes (he secured three Republican votes needed to pass the Recovery Act in 2009), and he has an unparalleled ability to get broad coalitions to line up in support of his agenda. For example, his recent clean energy jobs agenda has the support of the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters as well as the electrical workers union and the AFL-CIO. That’s pretty unheard of for a climate plan! And that’s the coalition you need to get a climate bill passed.",politics,1,1601489168,

Biden will also work to enact automatic voter registration and make Election Day a federal holiday. As he says, we need to make it easier for people to vote - not harder.

g7728bf,StefFeldman,"Biden recently said that this campaign is about Scranton versus Park Avenue. Biden is looking out for families in communities like Scranton. Trump is looking out for his billionaire friends on Park Avenue. I don’t think there’s a better summation of the choice here. 

There are so many people in the country just like you - financially struggling right now. And it didn’t have to be this bad. We are in this situation because Trump failed to get control of the virus. He still has no plan to get control of the virus. Biden does (joebiden.com/covid19). 

Biden will also provide immediate relief to working people facing immediate financial pain. For example, he’ll provide state and local fiscal relief so we can keep public school educators, firefighters, and other essential workers on the job. And he’ll provide funding that actually reaches our smallest businesses instead of primarily helping huge corporations.

Biden’s first priority will be to protect the health and safety of the American people and pull our economy out of this economic recession. He has proposed a plan to build our economy back but not just to the way it was before the virus or before Trump, but back BETTER. That means making sure that we are making the super-wealthy and corporations pay their fair share and investing in working families. Biden is going to grow our economy by creating millions of high-paying jobs that provide a chance to join a union, jobs that will at the same time help to solve our climate crisis and our caregiving crisis. He’s going to bring back manufacturing and supply chains to the United States. And he’s going to make sure communities of color historically left out of recoveries have a fair shot to get ahead this time around.

Speaking solely for myself, I think this is one of the worst parts of the Trump Administration - he is destroying faith in our government. Biden has released a full plan on ensuring that our government - including the President - works for the people. You can read his full plan at joebiden.com/governmentreform. It includes introducing a constitutional amendment to entirely eliminate private dollars from federal elections (that’s right, entirely). And it includes a number of proposals to rein in the executive branch, for example by preventing the White House from improperly interfering in federal investigations and prosecutions, and requiring all candidates for federal office to release at least 10 years of tax returns.

g77002x,StefFeldman,"Thank you so much for your vote and all you are doing to Get Out the Vote!!! We need to wind this in a big way (if others want to help us GOTV, visit joebiden.com/action).

Days are LONG on the campaign! But I can’t complain at all because I know many people all across the country are working much tougher jobs, much longer hours, and are struggling to make ends meet. Others have lost their jobs or have experienced a cut-back in hours and are worried about putting food on their tables. I do my job to help make their lives a little bit easier.

Working on the campaign is especially weird since we are all working remotely right now. Only a few people interact with the VP in person right now, because we are following the advice of medical experts. So I have a lot of conference calls, some with him and some with my team. Sometimes I realize that I’ve been on calls pretty much all day, and by 7pm or 8pm I have to actually start writing some memos or fact sheets.

VP Biden in person is much like you see him on TV. Kind and empathetic. Inquisitive. Passionate.

Stressful moments? There haven’t been any. Just kidding! The stakes feel so high so many moments feel high-stress. The good news is there is a whole team and we are working together to help VP Biden win and defeat Trump. And we have so much help from Team Joe, which isn’t just campaign staff but community leaders and volunteers all across the country.

On nuclear: VP Biden thinks that to address the climate emergency, we need to look at all low- and zero-carbon technologies. But he does have serious concerns regarding nuclear safety and waste. That’s why Biden will support a research agenda through ARPA-C to look at issues, ranging from cost to safety to waste disposal systems, that remain an ongoing challenge with nuclear power today.",politics,1,1601487233,
g76yjv7,StefFeldman,"Biden has his own plan, which we have outlined in two installments. It is a bold plan that recognizes climate change as an urgent crisis and meets the demands of science. It also recognizes that addressing climate change is really an opportunity to create high-paying jobs that offer a choice to join a union. The first installment of Biden’s climate plan ([https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/](https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/)) sets a goal of achieving net-zero emissions economy-wide by 2050, including by ensuring that polluters bear the full cost of the carbon pollution they are emitted. It presents exactly how he will retake the United States’ role as an international leader, not only by rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement but also by inviting all of the other countries to the U.S. to up the ante of our climate commitments. The second installment of Biden’s climate plan is really further detailing and scaling up the Biden climate agenda to meet the moment - which is an economic crisis worsened by Trump’s failure to get the virus under control (https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/). So, this plan is a concrete agenda to create millions of high-paying union jobs by building a clean energy future. We are talking about building electric vehicle charging stations, retrofitting 4 million buildings and 2 million homes to be more energy efficient, plugging abandoned oil wells and reclaiming abandoned mine lands, and more. He will ensure we are on a path to achieve a carbon-free power sector by 2035. And, Biden will make sure 40% of the benefits of this $2 trillion investment over 4 years goes to communities traditionally harmed most by pollution and climate change - low-income communities and communities of color.

I’m especially excited about this climate plan because VP Biden sees investing in clean energy and green infrastructure as an essential element of his economic recovery agenda. That means it isn’t just on his list of things he’d like to do someday - it is critical to his agenda to build back better right away.",politics,1,1601486670,
g76xdwd,StefFeldman,"This is one of my favorite questions. I think that when you are voting for a president, you are really voting for character and principles. When you see VP Biden’s policy positions, you are seeing his character and principles — he is the one who sets the agenda. For Biden, those principles are shaped by the families he grew up with in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the working people he served in Delaware, the people he has met over the past 10 years who tell them how the Affordable Care Act saved his life. Combine those principles with data and science from experts, and you’ve got a policy position.

One of the reasons I like working for VP Biden the most is because he is so principled. For example, he believes work should be rewarded the same as wealth, he thinks the middle class and working families built this country and unions built the middle class, he believes health care should be a right for all and not just the few, and he believes every person in this country should have a fair shot at being a part of the middle class. In many ways, it is easy to be his policy director because I generally know where he stands.

I think there are a couple of effective approaches to conversations. I’ve found that it helps to start off by listening to people and asking what they care about most. Then, counter misinformation and find common ground. There are a lot of lies being spread about VP Biden and his policy positions. You don’t have to know the answer off the bat - tell them you will look into and get back to them. (Here’s a good place to start for info on Biden’s policy position: [https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/](https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/).)

Many people I know who grew up conservative are deeply religious. So is VP Biden. He is a practicing Catholic. I don’t want to speak for him on this, so here is an op-ed he published last year about how his faith shapes why he is running for president and how he will serve: [https://religionnews.com/2019/12/29/faith-to-restore-the-soul-of-our-nation/](https://religionnews.com/2019/12/29/faith-to-restore-the-soul-of-our-nation/).

Lastly, I talk about VP Biden’s character. He has not forgotten the working families he grew up with in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont, Delaware. In fact, he has spent his career in public service trying to make their lives better. He is a husband, father, and grandfather. When his kids were young, he took the train home from Washington to Delaware every night so he could be with his kids. He treats everyone he meets with respect. Here’s one of my favorite videos about VP Biden as a person: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63zHc\_wa3U0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63zHc_wa3U0).

g9jbi35,bestem,"Again, my only issue with Stormlights multiple points of view is at the very very very beginning of the first book. Once you get to Kaladin's second chapter than I don't view it as an issue any longer. The very beginning of Way of Kings does not feel like you're reading a cohesive novel, but a bunch of unrelated chapters that all feel like they're from different books.

Then Kal's second chapter follows his first chapter, and it no longer feels that way. And it is many more chapters before you get to the first interlude, and are reintroduced to some of the people before Kal's chapter.  If the book started at Kal's first chapter instead of the prologue and then the first interlude, I wouldn't be making this argument at all. Switching between Kal and Shallan is not something that would keep me from recommending it to anyone at all. The interludes later in the book wouldn't either. 

I also don't think that a slow build book is a bad thing for someone who has not read for a while. I just don't think Stormlight is the slow build book to use. If it had been Mistborn instead of Stormlight on the list, I wouldn't have said anything.  The only reason why Stormlight is a more difficult entry point, in my opinion, is because of the sheer length of the books which means it takes much longer before it feels like anything is happening.

For some people neither of those things will matter. For some people you have a relationship with them and when they go from character to character at the beginning of the book and are confused when it's going to start coming together, you can tell them just read one more chapter, or when they're 2/3s of the way through and nothing of note gas happened yet, you can assure them that they're almost there. There are a bunch of other reasons I wouldn't mind recommending Stormlight to someone who hasn't read for decades, if I know the person I'm maki g the recommendation to.

But for a stranger on the internet with limited information at hand, I'm not going to recommend something that I've seen people who aren't new to reading looking at and wondering if they should even bother continuing to read the book (and as I said, both are fairly common complaints for Way of Kings).  Sanderson's writing is extremely accessible, and the Stormlight series is pretty amazing. I would have no problem recommending the books after the person has read 3 or 4 other books and is used to reading again.  

I don't need them to read dozens of books before I think it's a good recommendation, just... more than 1.  I don't think it should be first, unless I know the person and know that it's idiosyncrasies won't make them give up before giving it, and therefore reading, a proper chance.",Fantasy,1,1603285171,
g9id450,bestem,"Just because it might be more difficult to get into.  Neither trait is bad. But they are both things that make a large number of people give up on Stormlight. 

The character jumping itself isn't a problem at all. The fact that you have to go something like 5 chapters in before you get the same character for more than a chapter makes the beginning of the book difficult for some. Then it evens out and things are fine. 

The slow burn, similarly, is something I hear complaints about. If someone is bored with the slowness of the plot, they'll have a harder time sticking with it. Again, for most people, that wouldn't dissuade me from recommending the book. But for someone who hasn't read anything in multiple decades, I'm not going to suggest a book that you need to read 1000 pages of before you feel like things are happening.

I read this once, and I saved it.  If I have kids, I think I'd like to do this.

[The Secret of Santa](https://redtri.com/i-m-the-mom-behind-the-secret-of-santa/)

&gt;In our family, we have a special way of transitioning the kids from receiving from Santa, to becoming a Santa. This way, the Santa construct is not a lie that gets discovered, but an unfolding series of good deeds and Christmas spirit.  
&gt;  
&gt;When they are 8 or 9—whenever you see that dawning suspicion that Santa may not be a material being— that means the child is ready.  
&gt;  
&gt;I take them out “for coffee.” We get a booth, order our drinks, and the following pronouncement is made:  
&gt;  
&gt;“You sure have grown an awful lot this year. Not only are you taller, but I can see that your heart has grown, too.” I point out 2-3 examples of empathetic behavior, consideration of people’s feelings, good deeds etc, the kid has done in the past year.  
&gt;  
&gt;“In fact, your heart has grown so much that I think you are ready to become a Santa Claus. You probably have noticed that most of the Santas you see are people dressed up like him. Some of your friends might have even told you that there is no Santa.  A lot of children think that, because they aren’t ready to BE a Santa yet, but YOU ARE.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Tell me the best things about Santa. What does Santa get for all of his trouble?"" We work our way from “cookies” to the good feeling of having done something for someone else. “Well, now YOU are ready to do your first job as a Santa!”  
&gt;  
&gt;Now for the fun part! Make sure you maintain the proper conspiratorial tone.  
&gt;  
&gt;We then have the child choose someone they know–a neighbor, usually. The child’s mission is to secretly, deviously, find out something that the person needs, and then provide it, wrap it, deliver it–and never, ever reveal to the target where it came from. Being a Santa isn’t about getting credit, you see. It’s about unselfish giving.  
&gt;  
&gt;My oldest chose the “witch lady” on the corner. She really was horrible–had a fence around the house and would never let the kids go in and get a stray ball or frisbee. She’d even yell at them to play quieter. He noticed that she came out every morning to get her paper in bare feet, so he decided she needed slippers.  
&gt;  
&gt;His next task was to go spy on her and decide how big her feet were. He hid in the bushes one Saturday, and decided she wore a medium, so we went and bought warm slippers. He wrapped them up, and tagged it “Merry Christmas from Santa.” After dinner, he slipped down to her house, and slid the package under her driveway gate.  
&gt;  
&gt;The next morning, we watched as she waddled out to get the paper, picked up the present, and went inside. My son could hardly contain his excitement, and couldn’t wait to see what would happen next. The next morning, as we drove off, there she was, out getting her paper–wearing the slippers. He was ecstatic. I had to remind him that NO ONE could ever know what he did, or he wouldn’t be a Santa.  
&gt;  
&gt;Over the years, he chose a good number of targets, always coming up with a unique present just for them. One year he chose the daughter of some friends of ours, who were going through some tough times. Christmas for them was looking pretty bleak. With the help of his father, he polished up his bike, put a new seat on it, and with her parents’ permission, placed it on their back porch. The look on her face when she saw the bike with a big bow on it was almost as good as the look on my son’s face.  
&gt;  
&gt;When it came time for Son #2 to join the ranks, my oldest came along, and helped with the induction speech. They are both excellent gifters, by the way, and never felt that they had been lied to—because, instead, they were let in on the Secret of Being a Santa.

As my siblings and I got older, and my older brother and I knew Santa wasn't real while one or both of my younger sisters still did, my mom used to say ""as long as there's a spirit of love in the world, there's a Santa Claus.""  What this lady did with her kids seems to demonstrate that in spades.  I think she successfully transitioned from the magic of Santa, to the magic of gifting selflessly. and she did so in such a way that the kid isn't going to tell his classmates that Santa doesn't exist.  Because Santa does exist, just within all of us.",NoStupidQuestions,1,1603113446,

Once you find the pictures, paste them into a document in a Microsoft program (I'd use Publisher, but not everyone has that, so Power Point or Word), and then print them out.  You can even take them to your local office supply place to bind them once they're printed (or have the office supply place print and bind them).

That allows you to make catalogs not just for Christmas, but for any other event, like a birthday.

g8nvg7l,bestem,"&gt; I guess they’d have to have some kind of algorithm that checks the SKUs to see if they’re regular item SKUs vs print SKUs. 

But it isn't just print skus that need an invoice printed.  My store uses 2 invoices for print orders, one that we give to the customer and one that we write our names on and put in a bin so we can track OPCs.  We don't use the invoice after the job is complete (we just stick a job ticket on top of the order).  Some of my customers don't need a receipt (I have one regular that doesn't ever take his invoice and I know he won't), in which case I need 1 to print when I make the order and 0 to print later.  Once my store consistently reaches 60% or higher in OPCs (or if they give us better tracking options)  I won't need that second invoice anymore, and for small print orders I won't need the first if I had a way to pull it up at the register without scanning in the invoice.

On top of that, my print center is in the back of the store, and the majority of our save-the-sale's happen at the tech bench. Prior to the invoices not printing, every save-the-sale would generate two invoices in the back of the store, plus one invoice that we'd print to the manager's office (near the tech bench and registers).  In that case we just need to change the printer it prints to, and only need one invoice, but we still need that one invoice.  

Then there's ink subs.  They print an invoice when they ship.  We need 0 of those invoices.  There's also omni orders.  They print an invoice when they're picked, but there's also the receipt that prints to the ship from store printer.  We also need 0 of those invoices.  

So how is the system supposed to tell a recurring ink sub, ship from store, or pick ticket order, from a standard save-the-sale order?  How is the system supposed to know where we need to print save-the-sale paperwork, and where we need to print print-paperwork.  How is the system supposed to know whether we want 1 invoice printed prior to ringing up a customer, and a second when a print job is completed, or 2 at the beginning and 0 later, or 0 at the beginning and 1 at the end...  

So after realizing how much it's overprinting, they decided to print 0 invoices.  We can easily print all the invoices we need.  I would like to see them add an itemized invoice to print orders (along with the English version.  They can have an ""English version"" button and an ""Itemized version"" button), and I would like to see the option to print a ""finished"" invoice come up when we hit complete on print jobs, and I would like to see a way to have a list of invoices that haven't had payment collected on them yet able to be pulled up at the register so that one can be selected without any invoices being printed at all (like pulling up suspended transactions, but for orders), and I think after confirming a print job it should load onto the order rather than a list of orders so that we can select ""English"" (or ""Itemized"") without having to find the order in a list.  I think if they add in those things, then we don't need to automatically print invoices.

She tells me that we don't need to shame people for not wearing masks.  I let her know I wasn't shaming her, but the store could be fined if someone from public health came in and saw her without a mask on.  

She goes on to tell me that there are people shaming others for not wearing masks out there.  I don' t say anything.  She continues that she was just called a Karen for not having her mask on in a store the next town over.  I work in a fairly liberal university town, but the next town over is 100% a more conservative agricultural town and she just couldn't believe that in a place like that they'd care.

She then complains that she's not a Karen.  She's not an old white lady (she's in her late 40s or early 50s, so not old although definitely within range of the age that people called that generally are, and has burnished skin, likely of Mexican or Native American heritage, so not white).  I really really really really wanted to tell her it's not age or race, but attitude, and the attitude that she'd displayed to me in 3 minutes would be enough for me to label her that way if it were a label I ever cared to use (I know someone named Karen, I don't use the name a pejorative).  Anyone can be that narcissistic.  The fact that it seems middle-aged white people are more that way than others probably has to do with the fact that middle-aged white people are more likely to have the freedom to act rudely to those around them (as they can just go elsewhere if they anger enough people), and it has more likely worked for them in the past (so they keep doing it).

Instead I just listened to her rant with a mask on her face while I attempted to send her fax.  

I had never heard that before though.  I can't be a Karen because I'm neither old, nor white....  like middle aged white people have a monopoly on copping an attitude to people they perceive to be beneath them.",insanepeoplefacebook,5,1602267478,

He exits his email and opens it back up 3 different times while trying to find his sent box.  I told him he didn't need to leave the email, he just needed to select the menu at the top, and he told me ""well, I'm 72 years old so I don't know how to use these new fangled things.""

It was the right email, so I suggested he connect to our wifi, and directed him how to get there.  It still wasn't going through.  I helped another customer, and he came over to send it to the full-serve email.  I wasn't getting that either.  I went in back to get some more lamination for the customer I was helping, and my tech was back there so I sent him out to help the guy figure out why his email wasn't going through.

By the time I finish helping the guy there's now 5 people in line, so I make an OPC for his few copies, and ask if he wouldn't mind paying up front so I can start helping the next people in line (he has to go to the front to leave anyway, and there's no people in line up there).  He says fine, and goes up front.

Then we get a bad survey.  I refused to help him at self-serve.  I was extremely rude when he came over to do full-serve copies.

These days, step 2 is ""post in the copy and print group on Yammer.""  I want them to be able to figure out how to do things when me or my GM aren't around to do it for them.

There's also a lot of stuff in the training information that people forget or ignore.  I get that there's a lot to learn in copy center, and if you're not using it immediately, it's gone until you start using it again.  For instance, I'm 99% positive that in various training things (before the new round of STAR training, anyway) it said that all print orders have to be prepaid.  So you take that training, along with 8 hours of other training before you're ever set loose in the print center.  You've already forgotten it because of information overload from the computer training.  Once you're back there, if the person actually training you takes in an order and reminds you ""okay, now all print jobs are supposed to be prepaid"" and collects payment, then going forward you also start collecting payment on all print jobs.  But if the person training you allows the person to pay when they pick up, or prints things from email before they're paid for, or any number of other things that print employees love to do, you don't collect payment before jobs.  Two years later that print trainer is gone, and now you're training someone new, and even though the training says print jobs need to be prepaid, you have never put that into practice, so you don't train the new person it...

It's a lot to remember.  Computer and book training only go so far in print.

g31sqiv,jimmyjohnssandwiches,"As far as best, that’s kind of hard to say. The meta is super wide-open, and nothing can beat everything. As far as popular decks go, ADP variants, Pikachu/Zekrom variants, U Necrozma/Garb and Dark Boxes are pretty popular. Mewtwo Tag Team is annoying, especially with the ability to splash literally any GX Pokemon you want in it.

As far as what’s fun? Pretty much any deck that has been played competitively in the past few years can squeeze out a win occasionally, especially ones that newer players might not have much experience with. I would go with your favorites. Check on LimitlessTCG for deck lists in years past to get an idea of what people were playing, and just pick one that looks fun!

One that seems to remain surprisingly relevant (and my personal favorite) is Sableye Garbodor, which is one of the strongest soft lock decks out there. Unless you’re facing a fast energy acceleration deck or draw poorly, it always has a chance to win if you play smart.

Greninja BREAK is still fun if you like white-knuckling through those first 3 turns it takes to set up

Trevenant Break works surprisingly well if you can go second, as no turn one supporter basically eliminates one of the avenues that gave your opponent a chance. It still loses hard to dark and energy acceleration decks though.

Night March/Mad Party decks are always kind of fun, and is one of the few single prize decks that are really viable against ADP (you have room to tech with Pokemon Ranger, and the ability to find it almost every time). I cannot stress this enough, especially on the PTCGO ladder: you will get tired of facing ADP decks, and want a decent chance of winning every once in a while.

The only decks I wouldn’t recommend trying are decks that reaaaaaaallly needed a first turn supporter like Zoroark. Zoroark is nowhere near as good as it used to be (basically all of the bans in expanded were made to nerf Zoroark). 

I would also say decks from the EX era aren’t really worth it anymore. Seismitoad EX used to be a dominant force for years, but it doesn’t have enough HP or damage output to be viable nowadays.",pkmntcg,1,1598553082,

fz5eir1,jimmyjohnssandwiches,"Ah, that’s a nasty deck, and pretty old school compared to the way the game works nowadays. The idea is that you set up Gothitelle for item lock, then retreat to attack with Accelgor, which leaves your opponent paralyzed and unable to attack Gothitelle when accelgor is shuffled back into the deck. 

Since the deck is made to be able to search for Accelgor pieces, you just run through the deck setting up a couple of Shelmet so you always have an attacker. You use dusknoir to transfer that damage to benched Pokémon that could be a threat. You use Musharna to aid in the search for Accelgor pieces, kind of like a free acro bike every turn. Keldeo was a big thing in previous formats. Basically use it like you’d use Dawn Wings Necrozma.

Hope that helps! It’s a high skill level deck with a lot of moving parts, but it’s a nightmare to play against when you have a deck that’s unprepared for hit and runs.

1. If you are physically able, you would do better learning on a lower rung in the industry: a grip house. Not only will you actually make money that you can save up to use when you eventually go freelance, but you'll learn the names of and how to operate all of the equipment you would never encounter as a hobbyist. I knew a recent college grad in a similar situation to yours that worked with me. He saved up $10k in 6 months without even trying, and now is doing well as a PA on television sets. They will treat you terribly though, especially the dodgier ones. Pay scale is anything from $15-$22/hr depending on the place.

2. Those internships work you to the bone, and you usually start night shift. It'll be hard to find a flexible job. Basically those internships are for rich kids who don't need a second job. It's fucked up because you really do make good contacts, but usually that internship leads to nowhere unless you somehow get an offer or meet a photographer/cinematographer/gaffer that really likes you (which is even rarer).

If you think you can handle it financially, you should take the internship. If you can't, a grip house is for you.",photography,1,1581105069,

feh8of4,jimmyjohnssandwiches,"Hi everyone! I've been working on this team for the past week, and I think it's getting pretty close to being a coherent team (finally broke me out of a slump in upper Great Ball). The most unusual feature of this team is that it uses Xatu as a Tailwind/Rain setter, and I think it works pretty well as it's decently speedy, has access to Thunder Wave, and is immune to status moves via Magic Bounce. This really shines against Whimsicott teams, as it has access to three forms of speed control, none of which can be stopped by a Taunt. It also happens to be one of my favorite Pokemon, so that's a plus! Anyway, here's the team:

- U-turn

Duraludon @ Assault Vest  

Ability: Stalwart

Timid Nature  

IVs: 0 Atk

- Solar Beam  


Ludicolo @ Life Orb  

Ability: Swift Swim

Modest Nature  

IVs: 0 Atk  

- Energy Ball

- Protect  

Tyranitar @ Weakness Policy  

Ability: Unnerve  

Level: 50  

EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD  

Adamant Nature  

- Brick Break

Espeon @ Aguav Berry  

Ability: Magic Bounce

Modest Nature  

IVs: 0 Atk  

- Trick Room  

- Psychic  

- Dazzling Gleam  

- Reflect  



Most of the choices here are fairly self-explanatory, so I'll focus on the weird stuff. 

Passimian is good, but maybe it's because I'm using Receiver instead of Defiant but it doesn't do quite enough. I'm thinking of replacing it for another Close Combat attacker, because that and Knock Off are pretty much the only two moves I use unless I'm scouting with U-turn. 

I have Unnerve Tyranitar because it makes Snorlax much easier (and I can get Sandstorm with Max Rockfall anyway), but I'm wondering if Weakness Policy could be swapped out for something better.

Espeon is my anti-Trick Room setter because it can still function well as an attacker, especially since Conkeldurr is a big weak point for this team. It's also bulky enough to take a hit a good portion of the time.

Ludicolo is the only guy that really hard benefits from Rain on this team, but Rain Dance is still useful to mess with other weather teams.

So there it is! My EV spreads are kinda tentative, and I'm looking for a solution for my Passimian problem. I'd love any thoughts you might have. Thanks!",VGC,1,1579111443,

fednz0o,jimmyjohnssandwiches,"This turned out to be longer than I thought bc I liked theorycrafting. I think one thing you should do is examine what is different about the newcomers format.


 For example, a BIG thing I noticed when building my team is that there is no Intimidate in the format, so there is a bigger hole for aggressive physical attackers than there is in VGC2020. There're also no Mold Breakers (but no Rotom to abuse that fact). I think Dracovish will be a bigger thing than it has been because there is no Storm Drain to check it. Trick Room will likely have the same 6-10 setters/abusers, so just make sure you have plans for each.


Other things to consider are the combos that are popular that use Galar Pokemon. Do you have a solution for weak Surf+Coalossal? Can you handle Indeedee+Hatterene? (Your Duraludon says yes)

&gt; The ideological fears expressed by Graham eerily echo those of Althaus and other nationalist German theologians in the 1920s and 1930s: secularism, socialism, liberalism, pluralism, and urbanization. Althaus was particularly afraid of Überfremdung, the encroachment of foreign people onto German soil, an anxiety which mirrors the resentments of many Americans today against non-White immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers.

...

&gt; In 1933, German voters could not have known what nationalist ideology would ultimately lead to. Though warning signs abounded as Germany transformed into a dictatorial one-party state, the eventual world war and the expulsion and mass murder of Jews could not have been foretold. Once we give up on democratic governance, the long-term consequences are unpredictable.

&gt; President Trump’s authoritarian at­tempts to remake the US government—his erratic approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, his deliberate delegitimation of the upcoming election—have enjoyed his usual strong support among evangelicals. Of the many explanations offered for this political alliance, I think four are particularly helpful. **First,** the marriage of Trumpian-style governance with Chris­tianity cannot be understood outside American religious fundamentalism, which gained visibility in the 1920s and then re­emerged as a political force in the 1980s. **Second,** Trump’s self-proclaimed financial success echoes the prosperity gos­pel, the assertion that faith in God will be rewarded with material wealth and physical health. **Third,** evangelicals who believe in biblical prophecy and divine providence can see in Trump Cyrus the Great, who liberated God’s chosen people from Babylonian captivity: a secular leader who can turn a nation back to God without upholding biblical values in his personal life. **Fourth**, support for Trump is a manifestation of hard-nosed politics among religious leaders who share an agenda to reverse abortion rights, gay rights, and affirmative action and to undo the separation of church and state.

&gt; But what about the pope himself? Over the course of Trump’s tenure in office, few people have cut a more contrasting figure than Pope Francis, the former Buenos Aires bishop with a Jesuit dedication for social justice and the rights of the poor and marginalized. The two have already squabbled: In 2016, Francis suggested Trump was “not Christian” because of his anti-migrant rhetoric and desire to build walls between nations. Trump reacted angrily at the time, calling the comments “disgraceful” and warning darkly that when Islamist terrorists strike the Vatican, the pope would regret not supporting a Trump presidency.

&gt; The following year, Francis questioned how Trump could be “pro-life” while pursuing policies that broke up the families of immigrants and asylum seekers. In their sole meeting, in 2017, he presented Trump a copy of his treatise on protecting the environment and reckoning with climate change, but that hardly dissuaded the president from withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and undermining international efforts to curb emissions.

&gt; Their differences abound. The pope participated in a ceremony where he washed the feet of Muslim asylum seekers; Trump scaremongers over the threat of Islam and has blocked immigration from a number of Muslim-majority countries. The pope recently published an encyclical where he warned against “extremist, resentful and aggressive nationalism”; Trump’s brand of nationalist politics can indeed be seen as extremist, often aggressive and steeped in resentment. The pope has likened contemporary capitalism to “the worship of the ancient golden calf … returned in a new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money”; Trump, with his gilded mansions and debt-ridden business empire, is an acolyte of that cult.

&gt; Francis is back in the news this week with dramatic revelations that he appears to back civil unions for homosexuals. [...]

...

&gt; Trump, meanwhile, has allied himself with a camp that’s also ill-disposed to the pope.  [...]  “This faction’s positions on women, gay people, Muslims, immigration, socialism, and climate change are much closer to those of pro-Trump white evangelicals than to those of liberal Catholics, whom they consider not to be Catholics at all.”

...

&gt; The pope’s views, [the financial times,] Gardner added, fit far more easily with the Catholicism of Trump’s challenger, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. That’s not surprising. Carolyn Woo, former president of Catholic Relief Services and a co-chair of Catholics for Biden, told the Associated Press that the pope’s unconditional prioritizing of the “dignity of people” echoes the center-left politics preached by Democrats.

The idea of eternal damnation is neither biblically, philosophically nor morally justified. But for many it retains a psychological allure.

By David Bentley Hart
Dr. Hart is a philosopher, scholar of religion and cultural critic.

------------


Once the faith of his youth had faded into the serene agnosticism of his mature years, Charles Darwin found himself amazed that anyone could even wish Christianity to be true. Not, that is, the kindlier bits — “Love thy neighbor” and whatnot — but rather the notion that unbelievers (including relatives and friends) might be tormented in hell forever.

It’s a reasonable perplexity, really. And it raises a troubling question of social psychology. It’s comforting to imagine that Christians generally accept the notion of a hell of eternal misery not because they’re emotionally attached to it, but because they see it as a small, inevitable zone of darkness peripheral to a larger spiritual landscape that — viewed in its totality — they find ravishingly lovely. And this is true of many.

But not of all. For a good number of Christians, hell isn’t just a tragic shadow cast across one of an otherwise ravishing vista’s remoter corners; rather, it’s one of the landscape’s most conspicuous and delectable details.

I know whereof I speak. I’ve published many books, often willfully provocative, and have vexed my share of critics. But only recently, in releasing a book challenging the historical validity, biblical origins, philosophical cogency and moral sanity of the standard Christian teaching on the matter of eternal damnation, have I ever inspired reactions so truculent, uninhibited and (frankly) demented.

I expect, of course, that people will defend the faith they’ve been taught. What I find odd is that, in my experience, raising questions about this particular detail of their faith evinces a more indignant and hysterical reaction from many believers than would almost any other challenge to their convictions. Something unutterably precious is at stake for them. Why?

After all, the idea comes to us in such a ghastly gallery of images: late Augustinianism’s unbaptized babes descending in their thrashing billions to a perpetual and condign combustion; Dante’s exquisitely psychotic dreamscapes of twisted, mutilated, broiling souls; St. Francis Xavier morosely informing his weeping Japanese converts that their deceased parents must suffer an eternity of agony; your poor old palpitant Aunt Maude on her knees each night in a frenzy of worry over her reprobate boys; and so on.


Surely it would be welcome news if it turned out that, on the matter of hell, something got garbled in transmission. And there really is room for doubt.

No truly accomplished New Testament scholar, for instance, believes that later Christianity’s opulent mythology of God’s eternal torture chamber is clearly present in the scriptural texts. It’s entirely absent from St. Paul’s writings; the only eschatological fire he ever mentions brings salvation to those whom it tries (1 Corinthians 3:15). Neither is it found in the other New Testament epistles, or in any extant documents (like the Didache) from the earliest post-apostolic period. There are a few terrible, surreal, allegorical images of judgment in the Book of Revelation, but nothing that, properly read, yields a clear doctrine of eternal torment. Even the frightening language used by Jesus in the Gospels, when read in the original Greek, fails to deliver the infernal dogmas we casually assume to be there.

On the other hand, many New Testament passages seem — and not metaphorically — to promise the eventual salvation of everyone. For example: “Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.” (Romans 5:18) Or: “For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.” (1 Corinthians 15:22) Or: “He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.” (1 John 2:2) (Or: John 13:32; Romans 11:32; 1 Timothy 2:3-6; 4:10; Titus 2:11; and others.)

Admittedly, much theological ink has been spilled over the years explaining away the plain meaning of those verses. But it’s instructive that during the first half millennium of Christianity — especially in the Greek-speaking Hellenistic and Semitic East — believers in universal salvation apparently enjoyed their largest presence as a relative ratio of the faithful. Late in the fourth century, in fact, the theologian Basil the Great reported that the dominant view of hell among the believers he knew was of a limited, “purgatorial” suffering. Those were also the centuries that gave us many of the greatest Christian “universalists”: Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, Didymus the Blind, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Diodore of Tarsus and others.

Of course, once the Christian Church became part of the Roman Empire’s political apparatus, the grimmest view naturally triumphed. As the company of the baptized became more or less the whole imperial population, rather than only those people personally drawn to the faith, spiritual terror became an ever more indispensable instrument of social stability. And, even today, institutional power remains one potent inducement to conformity on this issue.

Still, none of that accounts for the deep emotional need many modern Christians seem to have for an eternal hell. And I don’t mean those who ruefully accept the idea out of religious allegiance, or whose sense of justice demands that Hitler and Pol Pot get their proper comeuppance, or who think they need the prospect of hell to keep themselves on the straight and narrow. Those aren’t the ones who scream and foam in rage at the thought that hell might be only a stage along the way to a final universal reconciliation. In those who do, something else is at work.

Theological history can boast few ideas more chilling than the claim (of, among others, Thomas Aquinas) that the beatitude of the saved in heaven will be increased by their direct vision of the torments of the damned (as this will allow them to savor their own immunity from sin’s consequences). But as awful as that sounds, it may be more honest in its sheer cold impersonality than is the secret pleasure that many of us, at one time or another, hope to derive not from seeing but from being seen by those we leave behind.

How can we be winners, after all, if there are no losers? Where’s the joy in getting into the gated community and the private academy if it turns out that the gates are merely decorative and the academy has an inexhaustible scholarship program for the underprivileged? What success can there be that isn’t validated by another’s failure? What heaven can there be for us without an eternity in which to relish the impotent envy of those outside its walls?

Not to sound too cynical. But it’s hard not to suspect that what many of us find intolerable is a concept of God that gives inadequate license to the cruelty of which our own imaginations are capable.

An old monk on Mount Athos in Greece once told me that people rejoice in the thought of hell to the precise degree that they harbor hell within themselves. By which he meant, I believe, that heaven and hell alike are both within us all, in varying degrees, and that, for some, the idea of hell is the treasury of their most secret, most cherished hopes — the hope of being proved right when so many were wrong, of being admired when so many are despised, of being envied when so many have been scorned.

And as Jesus said (Matthew 6:21), “Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”

&gt; Frankly, since the publication of “Bonhoeffer Moment No. 1” in September, dangerous threats to freedom have only increased, evidenced in the arrest of 13 militia-related white males charged with plotting to kidnap and perhaps kill Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whose coronavirus mandates they believe violated the Constitution. They are alleged to have staked out Whitmer’s vacation home as a possible site for the kidnapping, experimented with bomb-making, and contrived to attack the Michigan state capitol building.

&gt; Writing in the Oct. 11 Huffington Post, journalist Christopher Mathias notes that these individuals mirror the armed aggressiveness of many militia-based provocateurs, promoting conspiracy theories and anticipating a “new American civil war,” with many “eager to fire some of the first shots.” [...]

&gt; Mathias calls attention to Yale professor Jason Stanley’s book, How Fascism Happens, and the assertion that unchallenged hate speech by “public leaders,” when normalized, can morph “five to six” years later into “the normalization of violence and mass violence.” Stanley highlights the close relationship “between the rhetoric and the unofficial militia,” and concludes. “That’s what we’re looking at right now.”

&gt; Should Christians and churches heed these warnings? [...]

[we will know in a few weeks]

...

&gt; Bonhoeffer’s words did not end with simple prayers for freedom, as important as that is. He warned us against maintaining a “false composure which is quite unchristian,” adding that, “As Christians, we need not be at all ashamed of some impatience, longing, opposition to what is unnatural, and our full share of desire for freedom.”

...

&gt; In ways that are distinct yet parallel to Bonhoeffer’s generation, I believe that’s where we are right now in our own country. [...]

&gt; Jerry Cook, lead pastor at Freedom’s Way church, said in a sermon last Sunday that there was “no problem” with the unofficial ballot box, CNN reported: “Freedom’s Way Baptist provides the option to its parishioners to drop off their ballot in a safe location. Isn’t church pretty safe? In a safe location with people they trust rather than handing it over to a stranger who knocks on their door, which is something called ballot harvesting.”  

&gt; Criticism of this effort is unfounded, the pastor added. “They are suggesting that something nefarious is happening with the ballots here, that perhaps the pastor of the church is counting the ballots and looking through and saying, ‘That’s a Biden voter, we’re going to throw that away’ and then we’re going to go ahead and go with the Trump voters,” he said.

&gt; The most painful moments of the hearing may have come when Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) took her through basic facts about voter suppression and bias in the criminal justice system. Her reactions suggested that much of the gross injustices faced by Black Americans, as Booker laid them out, were news to her. In an embarrassing admission, she could not identify any books, law review articles or studies on the legacy of racial discrimination — this at a time when many books on the subject are bestsellers. Not only did she come off as unknowledgeable about a critically important topic, but she apparently also has had no interest in getting up to speed on the great fault line through American life.  

&gt; She either did not care (because the fix is in) or lacks the mental dexterity to show herself to possess basic knowledge and moral reasoning skills without adopting a position that would imply she is biased in an upcoming case. Oddly, she previously had felt no such hesitation in declaring certain principles that just so happen to please her conservative supporters — e.g., that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. stretched the text of the ACA to save it.

&gt; The general impression one gets from Barrett is that she is less knowledgeable about U.S. contemporary life than any Supreme Court nominee in recent memory, with the possible exception of Robert Bork. She cites theories of jurisprudence with ease, but she cannot acknowledge obvious political realities and facts about economic power, discrimination and science. That is a recipe for rigid, abstract judicial reasoning. Despite her insistence to the contrary, she seems to treat jurisprudence in a vacuum, with little regard for how it will affect others with whom she has little familiarity.

...

&gt; The hearing might nominally have been about Barrett’s confirmation, but it turned into a cringeworthy display of right-wing ideologues’ ignorance, if not indifference, to unpleasant realities in American life.

&gt; [My research](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/8484/2547) suggests that President Trump seems to have developed a rhetorical style to appeal to this constituency.

...

&gt; In the presidential speeches I examined, Trump used 7.3 religious terms per thousand words of speech – far higher than any other president from the last 100 years. In fact it was more than double the average rate of 3.5 terms per thousand used by presidents in general. Similarly, explicit mentions of “God” by Trump came at a rate of 1.4 per thousand words – almost three times the average of 0.55.

&gt; The average length of presidential speeches in the archive was around 3,000 words, with each speech containing on average 10 religious terms and one or two specific mentions of God. Trump’s speeches were similar in length but contained on average 22 religious terms and four mentions of God.  [see the chart in the post]

...

&gt; President Trump also has the speech with the highest rate of use of religious terms: an address following a 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting. That national address contained 52 religious terms per thousand words – although I would note that it was a short speech, only 754 words long. Other presidential speeches following national tragedies – such as the 1986 Challenger disaster, Hurricane Katrina and the deaths of previous presidents – had a relatively high rate of nine religious terms per thousand words. Yet Trump’s Las Vegas speech is still over five times the average rate for these types of national addresses.  

...

&gt; I found that in the 2016 primary campaign, there was almost no religious language in his speeches. Notably, for example, he did not use the almost obligatory presidential speech conclusion asking God to “bless America.” But once he became the official Republican nominee, he sharply increased his use of religious language, and has maintained that high frequency into his presidency.

&gt; Interestingly, in speeches in states with a more religious population he used significantly more religious language than in more secular states. In the most religious states, such as Mississippi and Texas, Trump used on average 1.7 religious and 0.36 God terms per thousand words. In the least religious states, like New Hampshire and Maine, these figures were 1.2 and 0.24.

...

&gt; My data shows that President Trump has significantly changed how he uses religious language in communications.

&gt; Why this is the case is unclear. Some supporters, such as evangelical leader James Dobson, argue that Trump is finding his faith. And it could be that these findings reflect an increasing importance of religion to Trump personally.

&gt; I am an evangelical Christian who has not attended church in person since March. I wish I could say that COVID-19 is the only reason I have not returned.

&gt; It has been nearly four years since I learned that 81% of white evangelical voters pulled a lever for Donald Trump on Nov. 8, 2016. I still feel betrayed by my own people. There are days when my anger remains raw.

&gt; This is not an indictment of the leadership at my Pennsylvania megachurch. They are serious Christians. Most of them are doing their best to navigate this divisive political season without dividing the congregation. I appreciate the work they are doing, and I have taken notice of their attempts to apply biblical faith to our current moment without naming names or “getting political.”

&gt; But I also get the sense that my church is keeping me at arm’s length. This may well be a smart move, since I am a divisive figure. I have tried to use my voice and platform to criticize a morally corrupt president of the United States and the Christian and conservative media infrastructure that props him up. Some of my fellow churchgoers have read my book “Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump” and have sent me wonderful notes of encouragement and support. Others have made it clear that they believe I am a negative influence in the evangelical community.

&gt; Why am I bringing this up right now? Last week I had an emotional conversation with an evangelical Christian whom I love deeply. This person does not understand how friends, family and fellow Christians can support the current president. The first presidential debate upset my friend. How could Christians vote for a man who refuses to condemn racism, lies endlessly and lacks basic empathy? My friend is considering giving up on church and the Christian faith.

...

&gt; I do not want my friend to give up on Christianity. I encouraged this person to lean into our shared faith and not pull away. I shared how current events have led me to read the Bible with new eyes, pray in different ways, and rethink how I live my Christian life.

...

&gt; This is an election between one man who believes that the president should be a steward of democracy and another man who is a racist, nativist and narcissist willing to undermine democracy with almost every word he speaks.

&gt; And most white evangelicals, whether they love Trump or held their noses and voted for him, are complicit. I know that statement will anger a lot of the Christians in my evangelical tribe, but I am also angry. How long will evangelicals continue to support — either directly or indirectly through their silence — this immoral president? In his Second Inaugural Address, Abraham Lincoln preached national unity. He called us to “bind up the nation’s wounds” and “achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace.” But let us remember that Lincoln delivered his address after the Union victory over the slave-holding Confederacy was all but secured.

&gt; The cancer at the heart of the republic and evangelical Christianity must be cut out. When Trump is gone, I hope and pray I will be ready to participate in the healing process.",Christianity,1,1602521774,

&gt; The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, more than two years after it acknowledged its complicity in slavery, still has the names of Confederates James Boyce, John Broadus, William Williams and Basil Manly Jr. on buildings and programs at its Lexington Road campus.

...

&gt; The names on buildings and programs is a sore spot with some in Louisville’s religious community and will almost surely be an issue on Oct. 13 when EmpowerWest, a group of Black and white church leaders who work for racial justice in Louisville’s West End, hosts an online discussion with Robert P. Jones, the CEO and founder of the Public Religion Research Institute.

...

&gt; Jones is an expert in religion and race. He won the Grawemeyer Award in religion from the University of Louisville in 2019 for his book, “The End of White Christian America.” Now, he’s back with a new book, ""White Too Long,” about the history of white supremacy in American Christianity.

&gt; In the book, he tracks racism in American religion — in Catholicism, mainline Protestant religions and evangelical Protestant religions. It’s in the evangelical Protestant religions where he said racism is the strongest.

&gt; Jones found that white Christians in the United States are more likely to have racist views than white non-Christians. And maybe more important, white Christians are less likely to see and understand systemic racism.

...

&gt; But Jones reserves some of his harshest criticism for the Southern Baptist Convention, the religion in which he was raised and which he writes was founded in 1845 following a break with northern Baptists over the issue of slavery.

&gt; Southern Baptists seceded before secession was cool.

&gt; According to Jones, Basil Manly Sr., who was the board president at the seminary when its first class graduated, was his day’s foremost proponent of a biblical basis for keeping African Americans enslaved, served as the official chaplain of the Confederacy and even gave the invocation when Davis was sworn in as the president of the racist and treasonous government.

...

&gt; James Boyce, the school’s first president, was a chaplain to the Confederate Army and used money from his family’s slave-dependent plantation to help build the seminary. He’s got a library and a college there named for him.

...

&gt; And William Williams, according to Jones, told a New York newspaper in 1866 we still maintain that slaveholding is morally right.” He’s got a building on campus named for him.

&gt; “The founding faculty of this school — all four of them — were deeply involved in slavery and deeply complicit in the defense of slavery,” said a report that Seminary President Albert Mohler commissioned in 2018.

...

&gt; Jones said the seminary needs to take serious and costly action to repair the damage that it did when it was founded in 1859. He noted that some other churches, including some Episcopal diocese have created multi-million dollar funds to make reparations.

...

...

&gt; “This record-breaking group of endorsers shows that President Trump’s lack of kindness and decency is energizing faith communities and will cost him this election,” said Doug Pagitt, executive director of the Christian campaign organisation Vote Common Good, which compiled the endorsements.

...

&gt; “Four years ago, many religious voters decided to look the other way and give Trump a chance, but after witnessing his cruelty and corruption, a growing number of them are turning away from the president.”

...

&gt; In July the Public Religion Research Institute found a seven-point drop in white Christian support for Trump, and a Fox News survey in August showed 28% of white evangelicals backed Biden, compared with 16% who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016.

&gt; A group called Pro-life Evangelicals for Biden said that, despite disagreeing with the Democratic candidate’s stance on abortion, “we believe that on balance, Joe Biden’s policies are more consistent with the biblically shaped ethic of life than those of Donald Trump. Therefore … we urge evangelicals to elect Joe Biden as president.”

...

&gt; One of those publicly backing Biden, Ronald Sider, president emeritus of Evangelicals for Social Action, said: “I urge everyone, especially evangelicals, to support Joe Biden as president. Poverty, racism, lack of healthcare and climate change are all ‘pro-life’ issues. On those and many other issues, Biden is much closer than Trump to what biblical values demand.”

...

&gt; As we saw in Wednesday night’s debate, Pence is not just the great enabler of Trump’s awfulness, but the man who puts a godly sheen on it. In that sense, he’s more dangerous, and arguably more evil, than Trump.

&gt; You have to think that he knows better, that he knows the man he serves is rotten to the core. But his sycophancy is not all connivance and cunning. No — he’s simply playing his role in God’s plan.

&gt; It’s taking potshots at a three-legged moose to note that if God planned to put kids in cages, to destroy much of creation with wildfire and flooding, to send more than 210,000 Americans to an early grave from a pandemic, such a plan would call for some dissent with the master architect.

&gt; Not from Pence. In the earthly realm, nobody expects the vice president to stand up to his president. Nor, even, to not do his bidding in the dark arts of Trumpism. But it’s putting a moral — and to Pence, religious — gloss on this American nightmare that makes his deep complicity so chilling.

&gt; His task on Wednesday was to lie and dodge with civility and aw-shucks earnestness. With his flat Midwestern accent and his silver-haired gladhandedness, Pence is the silk to Trump’s sandpaper. [...]

...

&gt; Indiana gave us Kurt Vonnegut and David Letterman and was a cradle for early African-American jazz recordings. But for a time in the 1920s, no state had more members of the Ku Klux Klan than Indiana — nearly one in three native-born white males. And this uniquely American domestic terror group was soaked in the rituals and piety of rural conservative values.

&gt; Pence doesn’t seem like a hater or a race-baiter, but he certainly makes his boss, who is one, more palatable to those who profess to live by godliness. When Trump gave the neo-Nazis at Charlottesville a pass, Pence was quick to the rescue, saying that under Trump, “We’re going to continue to see more unity in America.”

&gt; When the world was appalled at the cruelty of family separation at the border, Pence paid a visit, and said nothing to see here, because “We spoke to cheerful children who were watching television, having snacks.”

...

&gt; Pence, as head of the White House pandemic task force, should be crawling under a rock in shame. Instead, he’s all bromides and excuses. That “super spreader” event in the Rose Garden, with all the hugs and only a handful of people wearing masks? Well, it was outdoors, Pence said. Tell that to the wedding planners now going under because they couldn’t have their own special rules.

&gt; On health care, perhaps the biggest of the Big Lies of Trumpism, Pence said, “President Trump and I have a plan.” In fact, they have never unveiled a plan and are currently in court trying to dismantle Obamacare and its protections for pre-existing conditions. As with the pandemic, this is no mere policy difference, but blatant disregard for human life by an administration that professes to be “pro-life.”

anyway:

&gt; Prominent evangelical leaders have just released a statement urging pro-life evangelicals to vote for Joe Biden. [...]

&gt; The signers are diverse: a Trump voter in 2016; a lifelong Republican who refused to vote for Trump or Clinton in 2016; people who never before in their life publicly endorsed a presidential candidate until this year.

...

&gt; Their statement acknowledges that “as pro-life evangelicals, we disagree with Vice President Biden and the Democratic platform on the issue of abortion.”  “But we believe,” the statement continues, “that a biblically shaped commitment to the sanctity of human life compels us to a consistent ethic of life that affirms the sanctity of human life from beginning to end. “ 

&gt; The statement points out that many problems that better politics could correct violate the sanctity of human life. Poverty, lack of health care, racism and climate change all kill persons created in the image of God. They are all pro-life issues.

&gt; [...] Poverty is a pro-life issue.

&gt; [...]  Health care for all is a pro-life issue.

&gt; [...] Racism is a pro-life issue [...]

&gt; [...] Climate change is a pro-life issue.

finally -

&gt; We want to be clear. We mourn abortion and are committed to work to reduce the number of abortions. But three things are important.

&gt; First even if Donald Trump wins in November 3 and the Supreme Court overturns Roe v Wade, not a great deal will change. Gallup poll after Gallup poll shows that about 75% of the American people want abortion to be legal (although, fortunately, a majority also want some restrictions). So when the individual states recover the right to write the laws on abortion, abortion will be legal for most Americans. [that's true]

&gt; Second, the most common reason women give for abortions is the financial difficulty of another child. Knowing that, we appreciate the fact that a number of Democratic proposals would significantly alleviate that financial burden: accessible health services for all citizens, affordable childcare, a minimum wage that lifts workers out of poverty.  [that's correct]

Third, not just abortion but poverty, lack of health coverage, racism and climate change are also pro-life issues. The statement notes that the official public policy document of the National Association of Evangelicals (For the Health of the Nation) says: “Faithful evangelical civic engagement and witness must have a biblically balanced agenda”. Therefore the new Pro-life Evangelicals for Biden document says that “we must oppose ‘one issue’ political thinking because it lacks a biblical balance.""  [true again]

&gt; In this presidential campaign, Trump’s nationalist platform — trade, immigration — has faded into the background while his immoral nature has taken center stage. Compared to 2016, it’s more pure Trump and less Pat Buchanan.

&gt; The debate was an important moment. You and I can give sermons about how cruel, dishonest behavior shreds the norms of a decent society. But moral degradation is an invisible process. It happens subtly over time.

&gt; During Tuesday night’s debate, by contrast, people got to see, in real time, how Trump’s vicious behavior destroyed an American institution, the presidential debate. They got to see how his savagery made ordinary human conversation impossible. Debate watchers were confronted with a core truth: What Trump did to that debate Tuesday night is what he’ll do to America in a second term.

&gt; The group favoring Biden, set up by longtime evangelical leaders [Ron Sider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Sider) and [Rich Mouw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mouw), includes several leaders who have since retired from major evangelical institutions. Among them is John Huffman, who was board chair of Christianity Today magazine, a lifelong Republican and former pastor to President Richard Nixon. He is planning to vote for a Democrat for the first time.

...

&gt; The group for Biden also includes Jerushah Duford, the South Carolina-based granddaughter of late evangelist the Rev. Billy Graham, who said that she feels passionately about showing voters who describe themselves as “pro-life” that they can support a Democratic president.

...

&gt; The endorsements that came on Friday included Black evangelical leaders Brenda Salter McNeil, Bishop Claude Alexander and civil rights activist John M. Perkins, who have all said there is a fracturing between Black and White evangelicals over Trump’s presidency.

...

&gt; The group launching Friday said Biden’s policies are more consistent with “a biblically shaped ethic of life” than Trump’s.

&gt; “Poverty, lack of accessible health care services, smoking, racism and climate change are all pro-life issues,” the leaders said in a statement. “Therefore, we oppose ‘one issue’ political thinking because it lacks biblical balance.”

the idea that god will redefine you whereby one won't remember or will 'somehow understand' one's parents, bothers, sisters, sons and daughters and friends eternally separated from us in a terrible place damages god's power, justice and goodness.

st. paul was a universalist: 

&gt; In any discussion of Christian universalism, sooner or later someone is bound to mention Paul’s words about Christ saving everyone. Some of the passages are Romans 5:18-19 and 1 Corinthians 15:21f. One could add Paul’s words about Christ being the Saviour of all men (in 1 Timothy 4:10) and of Him appearing on earth bringing salvation to all (in Titus 2:11). One might broaden the exegetical field by referring to the Johannine report of John the Baptizer’s proclamation that Jesus is the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the whole world (in John 1:29), but such broadening would require a book dealing with all these passages, not a short blog post. (Those wishing to read such a book may find it here.)

He generates devastating stories faster than Biden’s opposition research team can compile them. We have every reason to believe things will get even worse for Trump in the days ahead.

1. Yes. I mean, honestly the opportunity cost weighs more on me at other times--like when I buy art or when I spend money on ridiculous luxuries like bath salts or fancy hotels--but it weighs on me some with Wimbledon.

But it also brings me (and thousands of other people) lots of joy, and helps a community I care about and feel close to achieve their dreams, and also in the scheme of things it's not much money.

That's a really interesting question. On a personal level, if I could go back to June of 2007 and tell myself anything, it would be to keep family and close friends the priority. There were times when the bright lights of fame/money/attention were really powerful draws to me, and I lost some important time with my family doing stuff that in retrospect didn't matter that much.

On a professional level I would say: The community that's growing up around these videos is way more interesting and powerful than you have yet realized, and the sooner you start working together to make the world suck less, the better. But maybe that would've ruined it; I don't know!

(I talk about this a little [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u90dGnKhhlk).)

Anyway, in answer to your question, I will tell you what one of my teachers told me. She held me after class one day and told me that she liked something I had written and that she would've read it in front of the class except that she suspected I wouldn't have wanted her to. (She was correct.) I wasn't a good student, and so hearing this positive feedback about my writing was a huge boost to me--in fact, it's possible that single comment is why I ended up pursuing writing. 

But right, after she said that nice thing about this little essay I'd written, she said, ""You're going to be okay, you know. Not in the short run.""

And then she paused and added, ""Well, and also not in the long run. But in the medium run.""

That gave me so much comfort, because it wasn't bullshit. I was so accustomed by then to adults lying to me--telling me that everything was all right, that I was safe, that nobody could hurt me, and so on--that I didn't expect her to tell me the truth. And when she did, I really felt like things WOULD be okay. In the medium run.

You're absolutely right that it's a lot scarier to read the podcast in front of an audience. I remember reading the ""Harvey"" episode at Podcon and feeling suddenly very exposed and scared. But I also felt ... I don't know how to describe it except to say ""cared for."" I didn't feel like I was in a room of people who were going to judge me or interpret what I was saying ungenerously or use it to be cruel or anything, and that was really lovely.

I find audio fiction work really interesting, and I enjoy it as a listener, but I don't think I'd be good at it. (It's probably closer to writing screenplays than writing novels, and I am a disastrously bad screenplay writer.)

Also, at the moment, I just don't feel capable of writing fiction, or at least not writing fiction that I can share with anyone.

g318514,thesoundandthefury,"Oh, yes. There have been many, many times when I've started or planned a review that just never came together. There are a few reasons for this that I'll try to explain via example:

1. I can't find multiple meanings or resonances to a story. One of the most requested reviews is for me to ""review the five-star scale on a five-star scale,"" which is a hilarious idea and I've always wanted to do it. The problem is that the five-star scale just isn't that interesting. Its initial use predates the Internet, but computers are the reason that the five-star scale has become so ubiquitous. (Like, for many years I reviewed books for Booklist Magazine. I wrote hundreds of reviews, and never once assigned a five-star rating to any of the books, because I was writing for human beings who read the reviews and didn't need a star rating to accompany them, because the reviews contained more information/nuance than a star rating can convey. But computers cannot effectively synthesize 175-word reviews, at least not yet, so we use star ratings primarily because they are helpful data inputs for computers, not primarily because they are helpful to humans.) All of this really interests me, but I couldn't find anywhere to go with it other than to the obvious place--which is that a lot of the data we collect for other humans is shaped by the computers that synthesize that data for us.
2. Sometimes, I would write a review and find that it was too personal, or it would involve someone whose permission I couldn't get.
3. For every review that gets finished, there are 10 or 15 I start that just don't end up where I need them to end up. I ended up using some of these in the [listener suggestion episode.](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/anthropocene-reviewed/episodes/anthropocene-reviewed-seventeen-listener-suggestions-reviewed) Like, I really wanted to write a review of Monobloc chairs, but I just couldn't find a way in to it.
4. A lot of stories don't lend themselves to the review format, especially if you only have 1,500-3,000 words to work with. One of the things I'm really enjoying about the book is that the reviews can be as long or as short as I want them to be, because there's no podcast format / advertising stuff to worry about.",nerdfighters,8,1598543907,John Green

Here are a couple recommendations of books that I find totally immersive and just take me away that you might enjoy:

1. The Adventures of Kavalier and Klay by Michael Chabon. This is a big, engrossing book that is also brilliant (it won the Pulitzer Prize) that will make you laugh and cry.
2. When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi. If you're looking to read a reflection on illness and dying, I've heard from people that this book made them feel less alone. It's a beautiful and heartwrenching memoir written by a young doctor toward the end of his life.
3. If you want to just laugh and go on a crazy adventure, I recommend Marie Semple's Where'd Ya Go, Bernadette? It's hilarious and ridiculous but then surprisingly moving at the end.

That's a great question, and it is one that I think about.

ebaimkv,thesoundandthefury,"First, thanks for your question, and for phrasing it thoughtfully and compassionately. Here's my honest answer, with the caveat that I might be wrong. I think issues around LGBT equality (when it comes to marriage, adoption, etc.) are not really political issues. They are human rights issues. I don't think people who would deny LGBT people the rights to live as full members of the social order are monsters. I think they're people. But I do think they're wrong on that issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't decide where the money raised during the second half of the p4a goes; nerdfighteria does. We changed things so that we raise money for pre-selected charities during the first half of the p4a precisely because we understood that many people, like you, might be uncomfortable or even offended by the charities chosen by the community.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry that you have felt separated from nerdfighteria because of your political and religious views. I'm guessing that you're a Christian, which means you and I probably share a lot of our core religious views, even though we likely have different understandings of scripture etc. I don't think our community can work without people within it challenging our values and our understanding of the world. It shouldn't be an echo chamber. At the same time, I am loathe to lift up voices that deny the personhood or rights of those who are marginalized by our social order. If it's possible to have non-ideological conversations that are about issues and policy and how we should organize ourselves as a community rather than about ideology-driven talking points, then I do really try to have those conversations. The example I always give is that I do try to engage with questions like, Should the top marginal income tax rate in the U.S. be closer to 35% or closer to 55%? That's a liberal/conservative conversation that I think can be open an constructive, and I want to listen to a variety of viewpoints. I do not think the question of whether certain people should be afforded the full and equal protections of the law is, however, such a conversation.",nerdfighters,4,1544194876,John Green

And so when i was trying to write the script, I was basically trying to do what people had told me to do--maybe Q should end up with Lacey, maybe they should work together at the school newspaper--and trying to make things dramatic and visual, but I really just had NO IDEA how to do that.

When someone is meeting me, I mostly just want them to have a positive experience.

g090ru3,mepper,"&gt; For Christian fundamentalists, being taught to suppress critical thinking begins at a very early age. It is the combination of the brain’s vulnerability to believing unsupported facts and aggressive indoctrination that create the perfect storm for gullibility. Due to the brain’s neuroplasticity, or ability to be sculpted by lived experiences, evangelicals literally become hardwired to believe far-fetched statements.
&gt; 
&gt; This wiring begins when they are first taught to accept Biblical stories not as metaphors for living life practically and purposefully, but as objective truth. Mystical explanations for natural events train young minds to not demand evidence for beliefs. As a result, the neural pathways that promote healthy skepticism and rational thought are not properly developed. This inevitably leads to a greater susceptibility to lying and gaslighting by manipulative politicians, and greater suggestibility in general.",atheism,37,1596484676,agnostic atheist

&gt; On April 13, Saudi security forces killed an activist named Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti. When authorities came to raid his house and arrest him, he opened fire, Saudi officials claimed.

&gt; It’s the first death connected to Neom, a proposed $500 billion city in a remote northwestern corner of Saudi Arabia that is a signature project for the country’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The de facto Saudi ruler says the metropolis will be stunningly futuristic, with residents’ every need met by robots and the so-called internet of things, and unique in the ultraconservative kingdom for relaxed social norms and laws. “You have no one there, so the regulations will be based on the needs of companies and the investors,” the prince, known as MBS, said in 2017.

&gt; But 20,000 people were there, mostly members of the ancient Huwaitat tribe ― including al-Huwaiti, who spent months speaking up for them in online videos before his government shot him to death in his own home.

&gt; Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates said his foundation will spend billions of dollars to fund the construction of factories for the most promising efforts to develop a vaccine to combat the novel coronavirus.

&gt; Mr. Gates, a billionaire philanthropist who is one the richest people in the world, said the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will work with seven makers of a possible vaccine to build these factories. Mr. Gates, who announced the efforts in an appearance on “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah” Thursday, acknowledged that billions of dollars would be wasted on vaccines that won’t pan out.

&gt; “Our early money can accelerate things,” Mr. Gates said. “Even though we’ll end up picking at most two of them, we’re going to fund factories for all seven, just so that we don’t waste time in serially saying which vaccine works and then building the factory.”

&gt; A representative for the Gates foundation didn’t respond immediately to a request for comment. In March, the foundation announced a $125 million effort to identify and develop treatments for Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

&gt; Confirmed coronavirus cases surpassed 1.2 million Sunday as the hardest-hit U.S. states and countries around the world manage an influx of patients with the pneumonialike illness. More than 69,000 people have died as a result of th
e virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

&gt; Dozens of drug companies, universities and other research groups have been working to develop a vaccine or treatment for Covid-19. Experts anticipate vaccine development could take anywhere from a year to 18 months.
“The only thing that really lets us go back completely to normal, and feel good about sitting in stadiums with lots of other people, is to create a vaccine and not just take care of our country but take that vaccine out to the global population,” Mr. Gates said.",worldnews,1,1586187907,

&gt; Many staff from the Wuhan lab have been training at a BSL-4 lab in Lyon, which some scientists find reassuring. And the facility has already carried out a test-run using a low-risk virus.

&gt; But worries surround the Chinese lab, too. The SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times, notes Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. Tim Trevan, founder of CHROME Biosafety and Biosecurity Consulting in Damascus, Maryland, says that an open culture is important to keeping BSL-4 labs safe, and he questions how easy this will be in China, where society emphasizes hierarchy. “Diversity of viewpoint, flat structures where everyone feels free to speak up and openness of information are important,” he says.

&gt; Yuan says that he has worked to address this issue with staff. “We tell them the most important thing is that they report what they have or haven’t done,” he says. And the lab’s inter­national collaborations will increase openness. “Transparency is the basis of the lab,” he adds.",worldnews,1,1579852987,

But OP chooses a specific, foul smelling dish and insists on eating that in his workplace where it clearly bothers other people. I'm not being condescending to Asian food whatsoever.

You see me say OP is an asshole because of the way he acts, and you apparently automatically jump to the conclusion that I for some reason hate Asians. How did you make this leap, I wonder? 

'Petulant brat' isn't a racial slur, my friend. It's the exact term for the way you're acting. Honestly I feel rather bad for you. It must be really tough to feel so personally victimized by the big bad world.

When you ferment these, they smell worse. It's about basic social behaviour, friend. If you stink up the office so bad that coworkers are annoyed, you're gonna have a bad time. These are the people you work with 8 hours a day, five days a week. You see them more often than you see your own family. Yet for some reason, OP doesn't give a shit when people ask him to eat something with a more pleasant smell. You are missing the point *so* much that even I got side-tracked. 

I said I love Indian food. I also love garlic. If possible, I would put garlic in a seringue and inject it directly into my bloodstream. But when I go to lunch with coworkers, I don't choose the dishes with the most garlic. Why? Because I can actually put my own basic needs on hold because of I care about the comfort of others.

I did a temp job (4 months) as a nurse in the occupational medical department of a large retailer. In those 4 months I spent 6 weeks completely reorganizing the archives (thousands of paper files) because there were hundreds of double files because the previous nurse just made a new one when she couldn't find the correct file. She couldn't find the correct ones because there was no alphabetical order anymore. I spent 4 weeks finding doctors to administer flu shots in the supermarkets of the chain because neither the previous nurse nor the manager (the doctor) did this in advance. I found doctors, scheduled the routes, asked HR for the money to pay them (this was a lot). It was extremely difficult because I was just trying to temp in a half forgotten basement department who didn't know anyone from the upper floors. I cleaned the entire department, replaced expired meds and bandages and such with new ones etc. Basically I worked my ass off because I hoped for a fix contract after the temp period. Unfortunately the labour
union denied this.

A few years later I was applying someplace else and I gave the doctor as a reference. A few days later the recruiter called me and told me the reference was bad. Dr said I was lazy, didn't do anything and basically just sat in my chair until end of business. I was more surprised than angry. Fortunately the recruiter gave me the opportunity to give another reference and that one was very positive.

fnfzmit,hyperchrisz,"not quite but nearly. the first verse is just absolute nonsense big word salad ( ""Inside of aeons from chaotic spires"" literally means nothing at all), the cheeseburger lyrics are all in the second verse.

&amp;#x200B;

""Sundered from daylight"" - to kill

""by the rage of the unseen"" - with an unseen weapon, basically instructions to slaughter a cow humanely with a captive bolt pistol or similar

&amp;#x200B;

"" Betwixt carbonic plateaus"" - between two flat carbohydrate based objects (burger bun)

""where rarity convenes"" - where you will find something rare (a rare-cooked piece of meat)

&amp;#x200B;

"" Under the heat of a thousand suns destruction is attained"" -  simply means cook it

&amp;#x200B;

""When flows the red and ochre histories ingrained"" - add ketchup and mustard. i like whole grain mustard hence ingrained.

&amp;#x200B;

fmoz99l,hyperchrisz,"Yeah maybe. If it was any other band wearing that though, you wouldn't call it a pirate costume.

What's interesting tho, is that for a genre (metal)  where the fans claim to be all about the music...there's very few, if any, actual comments on youtube or reddit about the actual song. It's all just comments about the aesthetic choices of the video. Which is disappointing really. The videos aren't the main focus, they're just something to grab your attention while we force the songs upon you. I did see some guy trying to say this sounds like ""rap music"", but I imagine they were having difficulty separating what they were hearing from what they were seeing.",folkmetal,1,1586271404,
fmoxqrg,hyperchrisz,"Keelhauled - pirate costumes
Shipwrecked - Chris has a ""pirate"" shirt on, everyone else is in generic metal guy clothes
Death throes - spooky metal guy clothes (winter clothing really)
Drink - rags and covered in mud
Magnetic north - lady Gaga costumes and homeless guy costumes
Mexico - Mexican dressup costumes
Alestorm - casual stage clothes

So yeah, that's 1.5 videos out of 8 where we wear pirate costumes. And 2.1 videos (Keelhauled and death throes, plus 2 seconds in drink) that feature a ship. So it's kinda weird for people to say ""you've changed, where is the ship and the pirate costume?""",folkmetal,1,1586270577,

I had collected up about 18 index points, planning on 20 (I now see that 15 is better TIL) and another player turns in. We're now at 90/100. The other people on the team tell me to turn in so we can finish, I don't want to turn in because that will waste a bunch of points for the next round. They say they don't want to play another round so I say that's fine you turn in and I'll do the next round solo, NBD.

Edit: I get that you are limited in the way you can compensate for these sorts of mistakes but please keep in mind that this is designed to be a game where we compete against other people. This is **most** relevant for blitz. If you give everyone energy it's like you gave no one energy. I still have a relative disadvantage compared to the people who didn't use any characters and also collect the same amount of energy. 

It's just like when the game was unplayable for two weeks for me as an android player, which obviously stifled my progress. My competitors whose progress wasn't stifled as much received the same compensation as me meaning that I was still at a relative disadvantage. 

It's great that you try to make up for it when there are issues but, by nature, they're always going to be disproportionate and not actually make up for losses.

I dabbled with Z80 in highschool, trying to write little toy games for my TI-83, but after a year I was only ever able to draw a box on the screen and move it with the arrow keys. The TI-83 is intended as a platform you can develop for. It has a whole operating system with nice easy to use libraries and stuff.

It's not all that useful today. Long ago it used to be used for the innermost loops of games, to improve speed. By the mid 90's it was only used in underpowered embedded devices. But nowadays, you can get a $5 computer running linux where you can compile everything in C or whatever language you want, without caring too much about performance. Even embedded devices have little use for ASM anymore. Hell, for over five years now they've been selling wifi SD cards with tiny linux computers in them where everything is coded in PHP, because even five years ago, in a $50 SD card, you have enough CPU power to run an entire LAMP stack.

Anyway, be aware that ASM is different for every CPU, though the concepts are mostly the same. Learning Z80 assembly is especially useless today. x86 is slightly more useful, but I'd learn ARM assembly if you want it to be worth your time. That's typically what you find in phones, tablets, routers, etc, other tiny underpowered devices where assembly could potentially still be useful. ",programming,7,1456242526,

The maillard reaction (pronounced my-yard) is a really complex chemical reaction that happens when sugars and amino acids are heated. All the brown crusty stuff on the outside of a steak that gives it its flavour is a result of the maillard reaction. 

Most french sauces start off by scraping the brown crusty shit off the bottom of the pan when you're done cooking meat. This stuff tastes *amazing*, and makes the base of a sauce when you ""deglaze"" the pan with liquid to boil and dissolve the brown crusty bits.

Searing the meat involves high heat and results in a dark brown crust on the meat. This didn't happen in this recipe, or if it did at all, he burned the shit out of the spice mixture he added to the chicken at first. To start this out correctly, you want to brown the chicken before you add the spice mix, which will burn at the temperatures you need to sear the meat.

Well, that's your budget right there.

The DL580 looks like it should work. It has two PCIe 2.0 8x slots, which shouldn't impact the performance of the cards. The CPU supports VT-d, which is crucial to do PCIe passthru. It has several beefy power supplies which can handle the cards, and it's 4U so physically big enough to hold the cards. Looks like a good choice.

That said, I'm not sure you need 16 cores / 32 threads for gaming. At 1.8ghz I'd rather have fewer, faster cores for non-server workloads. Also, 128gb of ram is of course overkill for two gaming VMs, as no game in the immediate future will ever require or even make use of 64gb. It's good to have though, if you want to play around with running a whole bunch of VMs later though. Another thing to think about is replacing the drives with one or more SSDs, but you'll have to budget for that.

dkz63xv,ggggbabybabybaby,"&gt; And what's the difference between native 4k and upscaling (Since PS4 Pro apparently id upscaling while XOX is native)

Native 4K means the game is rendering a 4K image. Upscaling means it's rendering a lower resolution image and scaling it up to 4K. *Some* Xbox One X games will be native 4K but a lot of them will use similar tricks to the PS4 Pro to render something that is better but ultimately not true 4K. But, since the XOX has more powerful hardware, it's very likely that the graphics and performance will be superior to the PS4 Pro.

&gt; Would a Xbox One X still be good to buy if I just have a 1080p TV?

Would you see an improvement over the standard Xbox One S? Yes. Will it be a big enough improvement to justify the price difference? That's up for debate.

c3aqrf3,ProbablyHittingOnYou,"&gt; Sure its nice that a company can only pollute X amount, but the creation of limit prevents any incentive to ever pollute less than that limit. That is how the EPA ""works"".

That's not true at all. [The EPA often uses a market system](http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progsregs/arp/s02.html) that allots a certain amount of available pollutant, which can be sold to others. This gives them an incentive to innovate based on what the market price is. This has been remarkably effective in reducing pollutants.

&gt; Also, there would be nothing stopping the state from starting an agency to monitor and bring cases against corporations who pollute.

Most states already have their own form of the EPA, but the problem is that the environment isn't constrained by state boundaries. If Alaska has no laws about air pollutants, then that will effect the entire west coast, because air currents bring Alaska's pollutants down. 

&gt; Class action law suits?

Still require funding. Lots of it. Cases from the Exxon Valdez case are *still* being settled. If we allow only class actions to regulate environmental law, then plaintiffs will all die before their cases are settled.",politics,10,1324697760,
c3aqm4r,ProbablyHittingOnYou,"You missed some huge issues that come up when dealing with the courts.

The first is proving that the pollutant came from the factory. If you need 200 parts per billion, and the factory next door to you only emits 100, then they're not the sole cause of your injury and can't be held liable. 

Second, you need to prove that they're the cause of your injury. Let's say you live in the same town a huge pollutant, but you live upwind of them. Even if you get cancer, they could claim that you're not being affected by them, and it must be someone else. Environmental causation is so loose that it's almost impossible to prove that they're directly responsible.

Third, you need to prove that it was the pollution that caused your injury, and that it wouldn't have occurred without it. Let's say you're a smoker and you live next to a polluting factory. You develop lung cancer. Would you still be able to sue the factory, and claim that they caused your lung cancer? It's even harder when the effect they had was significant but not big enough to have an established effect.

Needless to say, these are all components of your third point, that the company has a huge advantage in the court system. These suits can take years, can be incredibly expensive, and the plaintiffs often have huge medical bills that they have to pay at the same time. 

Furthermore, the effects often don't show up for years. Who's to say that the polluting company even exists when you develop some disease 30 years after the fact.

And finally: what's the ""just compensation"" that a court can award for *killing you*? Money for my family would be nice, but you know what would have been better? If my death had been prevented.",politics,64,1324696601,

The original formulation of Crayola copper and gold colored crayons contained bronze powder, which in the presence of stearic acid will oxidize over time, causing the green color. This oxidation process is the same as occurs on a penny or the “Statue of Liberty” as a result of an acidic environment. We successfully reformulated the copper and gold crayons to prevent oxidation from occurring by using a blend of pigments to achieve the copper and gold colors. This formula change took place during 1994 and continues today in both the copper and gold crayons.”",mildlyinteresting,312,1601348386,

http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1140256

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volenti_non_fit_injuria

http://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/business-contracts-forms/will-your-contract-be-enforced-under-the-law.html

Entering into a contract is an exercise of volition and consent. Signing a contract, though, is not an act of ""consent"", and no one questions whether someone is able to give their consent. That's not how contract law works. When someone is drunk, it has nothing to do with consent and everything to do with unfairness of bargaining and an artificial or contrived imbalance of bargaining position. The law does not state that someone is legally unable to give consent when intoxicated. What they do say is that a contract may be made unenforceable if it can be shown that their was an unfair advantage in the forming of a legally binding contract.

Further, sex has NOTHING to do with contract. This line of reasoning is a complete misappropriation and misapplication of legal theories, practices, and terminology. Sex constitutes ZERO legal obligation on either party. No one is compelled to do anything for any period of time and there is zero expectation of services rendered or prohibition of any activity. The idea that sexual activity somehow constitutes a contract or quasi-contract is laughable.

Impaired people absolutely CAN give consent. I know, I do it all the time. Many other people do as well. I engage in contracts while intoxicated as well. If I didn't, how could I ever agree to pay for my drinks with a credit card, or get in a cab after drinking, or any of the other various commercial activities everyone engages in on a regular basis. These things, unlike sex, actually do constitute real contracts and quasi-contracts, and there is zero question as to the intention of the parties nor the fact of the presence of mind of the intoxicated individual nor of their consent.

Feminists should do some reading on the topic instead of making up legal theories that have zero basis in reality.

ch3fgtf,red321red321,"TL;DR: The Disappearing Man Without A Face.

Before you read any further, I'm just letting you know that this is not a tree fiddy story or a troll post and that this is a story that I talked a little bit about two years ago in AskReddit but I never went as far in talking about this experience as I will now. I can't really give you a TL;DR because it would ruin the story so I've given this story a title in its place.

I used to live next to two people when I was a kid growing up before I moved. I had no neighbors that 
lived behind me because my yard was pretty big and there was a creek behind my house and no neighbors who lived in front of my house because it was just a bunch of trees and a trail that led to a park. On both sides of my house I had neighbors. The neighbor to my left was a middle-aged woman who had lost her leg during a car accident when she was a teenager and she was cared for by her parents who lived in the same house with her. I was always friendly with them and my mom would take me over to their yard to play with their dog with the lady because she was isolated from most of society and because I was a young kid who loved playing fetch with dogs and running around with them. On the other side of my house I had a 65 year-old man who lived with his wife and who mostly kept to himself but did talk to me from time to time. He had these three really cool cars from the 50s, 60s, and 70s that he used to shine up and work on and he used to let me wash his cars from time to time in the Summer and even brought me cookies that his wife made for me as a way to thank me. Two things that stand out all these years later is that I can't remember the man ever appearing with his wife at the same time and that I can't remember my mom ever getting close to the man like I did. My mom used to wave to him from our steps about 30 yards from his house but she never really talked to him and never got very close to him or his house.

I was between 6 and 10 years old when the man began to talk to me on occasion and let me look at his cars, wash them, sometimes sit in the driver's seat and pretend to race, and give me the cookies that his wife baked for me. I cannot remember what his face looked like at all but I know that he was a White man that was about 6 feet tall with greyish hair that he often covered with a golf cap. I must have been too young to remember the man but it still is strange that I honestly could not pick him out of a line-up if my life depended on me doing so. When I think about him, I remember that he had a soft voice that was almost like a whisper when he spoke to me yet I can't remember us talking about anything important which may have been down to my young age or that I was too preoccupied with looking at his cars and wondering if I was going to get some cookies from his wife that never talked to me (I think?) and who I cannot recall venturing outside of the house with her husband. When I was about 9 years-old I had what is easily the most disturbing and bizarre experience of my life.

It was a nice Summer day and I was outside shooting hoops in my driveway while my mom was inside watching TV and looking at me play from the window. I was working up a sweat and drinking some iced tea that mom had made at around noon when my neighbor appeared from his house and started chatting with me about how nice my jump shot was and how good at basketball I was going to be if I kept practicing. I was just a kid so I just smiled and nodded and said kid stuff back to him but don't remember much else. He then asked me if I wanted to wash his cars for him like I had done before that Summer and I was excited about doing so and said ""yes"" to him. He told me to go and ask my mom if I could do so and I ran inside to ask her if I could. She said that I could wash his cars for him but to do nothing else, stay where she could see me, and to come get her when I was done washing the cars. I was pleased with her response and ran back outside to the man's cars where he handed me a garden hose, a bucket, some soap, and a sponge to do the job. He stood on his step for a few minutes watching me getting all wet from the hose while I tried my best to wash his cars properly. After watching and churning out a few barely audible laughs, he asked me if I wanted Mrs. Neighbor to make some cookies for me and I happily said that I would love it if she did. The man then went inside and then went in and out of the house maybe 3 or 4 times in about 20 minutes before bringing me out a plate of chocolate chip cookies. I took a break from washing his cars to eat the cookies and I can remember thinking about where Mrs. Neighbor was but didn't pry because I was 9, didn't really care, and was too busy scarfing down cookies. I can remember that I never was able to look into the front of his home because he had his blinds closed almost all the time and I could never see into his kitchen very well because there was a big plant on the inside in a pot blocking my view of whoever was at the sink. 

Before I could finish the two cookies that I had left he appeared from his house and asked me if I wanted to see how it was that his wife made those cookies that I loved so much and - stupidly - I didn't listen to what my mom told me about staying in her sight and followed him into the house without giving it much thought. I had no reason to be alarmed when I set foot in his house for the first time because everything looked normal and he had a nice TV set with some car and baseball memorabilia in plain view on top of a shelf above the TV and on top of his mantle above his fireplace as well. The house looked well-kept and nice and the kitchen looked nice as well and smelled even nicer. I followed him into the kitchen and he showed me the recipe book that his wife kept with the cookie recipe and he started reading one or two ingredients before he said that he had to go and grab some chocolate chips out of his pantry in the basement and that I should sit at his kitchen table and wait for him to get the chocolate chips. Well, I did what he told me to do for about ten minutes before my brain started asking me where his wife was, why I didn't hear or see her moving around the house anywhere, and why it was that he was taking so long to just grab a bag of chocolate chips from his pantry. 

Now, it's obvious that I didn't listen to instructions very well and so I'm sure that none of you are the least bit surprised that I got off of that kitchen chair and slowly, quietly walked towards the basement door that he had shut behind me ten minutes earlier. I didn't want to get his attention so I slowly opened the door without making it creak or squeak and saw that there wasn't much light down there with the exception of what must have been a lamp or something illuminating only a small part of the visible basement stairs for me. I was very afraid that I would make the stairs creak or squeak on my way down them so I went down as slow as possible and held my breath so that he wouldn't hear me snooping on him. I wasn't scared at all about what I might find down there but I was concerned about him getting mad at me for not listening to him when he told me to wait for him to come up. The fact that he closed the door made me think that I should have listened to him as well. I slowly made my way down the stairs and when I got far down enough I dipped my head down and saw that the basement had one lit lamp on in the corner, some boxes, an old TV, some dusty furniture, and not much else that was visible given the poor lighting. What I could see was a door towards the back of the basement that was closed and I could see that there was a small bit of a light barely visible from under the door that came out on the other side where I could see it. At this point I was nervous because I didn't see the man anywhere in the basement, there was no sound emanating from anywhere that might be him, and after my eyes had finished darting around the basement I couldn't make out what could be construed as a pantry anywhere. There was the light of the lamp, the light from the day's Sun coming through a small window in the basement, and just the sliver of light coming from the underside of the door at the back of the basement that I could see from the bottom of the stairs. I still decided not to say a word or to call out for him by name because I was getting more and more nervous, confused, and afraid after being in that basement for no more than a few minutes. I don't know why I didn't go back upstairs instead of slowly moving towards the door at the back of the basement but I held my breath and slowly crept towards that door with my fists clenched by my sides and my eyes wide. I got within a foot of the door and could hear some breathing on the other side and maybe the rustling of clothing or hands being rubbed or pressed together but I kept quiet and kept one ear close to the door for a minute before standing back and deciding if I should knock, go back upstairs, look for his wife that I rarely ever saw upstairs or call out his name to see if someone would answer. 

Before I could make my next move I heard my mom yelling my name and I froze.  I froze and I also heard the breathing on the other side of the door freeze and whatever light was coming from the other side of the door quickly went out. I could hear my mom still yelling out my name in a panicked way yet I was still frozen because I knew that someone was on the other side of that basement door yet I knew that I needed to get up those stairs fast because my mom was yelling for me. I slowly turned around away from that basement back door and started to walk fast on my tip toes to the stairs and that's when the basement back door creaked open and I whipped my head around instinctively to see what was emerging from it. Out of that door came a woman in a blue dress with white flowers on it, two pearl earrings in her ears, white thong sandals, and a soft shade of red lipstick on. My eyes got wider than they had ever been in my life when I saw her and I couldn't move. My heart was in my throat because the woman seemed like she was towering over me while she stared at me with big blue eyes in complete silence. My mind was racing to come up with the answer to where the husband had gone but before I had time to work out my thoughts I heard my mom yelling at the top of the stairs at the basement door and I shuffled backwards, ran up the stairs, and was grabbed by my mom who started asking me why I didn't stay outside, why I was in the house alone, and where Mr. Neighbor was. She could sense that I had seen something so she asked me what was wrong but I just looked down at the floor trying to think of the words to explain what I had just witnessed. 

Before I could look back up at her a light from the basement was turned on and up came the woman that I had encountered. She wore a smile on her face now and on second viewing she looked like she could have been someone's grandmother. She smiled at me and my mom and asked us if everything was alright and my mom asked her where her husband was and why he had taken me inside their home without her permission. The woman told my mom that her husband had gone upstairs to rest and that she was going to show me how to bake the chocolate chip cookies that I loved so much and that she had been baking for me that Summer almost every week. At this point my mind was scrambled and I have a hard time remembering what was said next between the woman and my mom. The next thing I knew the woman was asking us not to worry about something and that she just thought that she should spend some time with me since her husband was always the one outside of their home spending time with me washing his cars, talking to me about my jump shot, and offering me the wife's cookies. My mom didn't turn around to respond to any of this and briskly walked out the door of the house with her arm tightly wrapped around me until we got back inside of our house. She sat me down on our couch, gave me a glass of water, looked into my eyes and said ""When I tell you to stay in my sight when you are outside I mean it!"". I was very shocked at this point and just couldn't process what happened in that house and just nodded very fast with my eyes wide open at my mom. She then went into another room and started talking on the phone with someone but I'll never be sure who it was that she was talking to. It could have been my dad or it could have been either the husband or wife next door but all that I remember is that she raised her voice while speaking and that she didn't sound happy at all. She then told me to stay inside for the rest of the day before putting on an episode of Pokemon for me to watch while I drank my glass of water. 

I really can't remember how I felt after that but I'm sure that I was in shock because I didn't bother asking my mom or dad about what might have happened over at that house and they didn't say anything about it to me other than ""You are not allowed to go inside that house ever again and are not to be outside on their property with them without our supervision."" I was too young to figure out what had happened in that house and I never bothered to ask my parents about it and they never, ever mentioned it in my presence for years. How could a 9 year-old kid understand what the hell just happened in that basement? Well, by the time I was 14 years-old I had my answer to what happened in that basement on that Summer day. 

I was at my new house that I had moved into a year earlier and my aunt and mom were in the dining room talking about whatever while I was in the TV room watching SportsCenter or something and paying no attention to their conversation. Suddenly, my TV watching stopped when I was able to hear them talking about our old house and about our neighbors. I lowered the volume on the TV just enough to not arouse suspicion that I was listening and then found out the answer to the mystery of that scary and extremely confusing day that I had when I was 9 years-old. It turns out that the man and woman living next door never was. It turns out that my neighbor was a transvestite and that the reason why I can't remember ever seeing the husband and wife together at the same time was because the husband was the wife and vice-a-versa. This revelation blew my mind. I'm old enough now to understand that there are people like this out there but as a 9 year-old it was the most disturbing and creepy thing that I had ever experienced and it stayed that way until I was 14. To this day that woman emerging from that back basement room in place of the husband is the most disturbing shit that I have ever witnessed in person.

ch0nld8,red321red321,"The last two episodes worried me because episode 7 was the weakest of the season and last week's episode wasn't anything special. This week's episode was right up there with the episode where Elizabeth wants Phillip to be Clark and it goes horribly wrong for them and together they've been the two best episodes of this season. I've been really waiting to see how they're going to play this series because anyone who knows a good deal about espionage, The Cold War, and family life in upscale suburbia knows that most of the time there is a lot going on psychologically, emotionally, and in the mind with smaller doses of action/problems thrown in here and there. I've been worrying that this series and this season is going to struggle with the ""Holy Shit!"" moments that I've become used to with my favorite serial dramas like The Wire, The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, etc. but any lack of ""wide-eyed"" moments for me seems to be seriously eased by what is going on in the minds and souls of the characters so far. 

Thus far, it looks like the writers have done incredibly well with the  Paige storyline and religion creeping into the Jennings's life. I wasn't sure where the writers were going with this storyline but it looks like they have managed to intertwine it with Phillip's storyline because he clearly has some conscience and the murders that he has carried out and his life as this killer is making him question his purpose in life. When he lashes out at Paige and her Bible and when he stares dead-eyed at the preacher during the mass you know that he's not mad at religion for the same reasons that Elizabeth is (""opiate of the masses"") but is more angry at it because it's causing him to dig deep into his soul and to question whether or not he would be going to heaven or hell if he wasn't a Godless communist but instead a God-loving or God-fearing suburbanite in Reagan's America. This becomes clear when he goes at night to the church to confront the pastor yet he isn't truly set on hurting him even while he stands face to face with him. The pastor acts more as a mirror for Phillip's own inner thoughts that he was been wrangling with than as an individual who happily took a 600 dollar donation from his daughter. The pastor knows full well that it's not about the money and he says as much which convinces me that he is acting as a mirror for Phillip and Phillip is angry because he doesn't like his reflection nor the thoughts that he has failed to push away concerning his double life where he plays a happy husband living the American Dream with his family half the time and a man who must be a cold-blooded killer at any given time for an ideology and war that he is growing tired and skeptical of. When Phillip asks him if he believes that people can really be saved he's basically asking the pastor if he can be saved or if the murders he has committed will destroy him.

From what I have gathered so far, I think that the writers are going to make the central theme about defection, where loyalty lies, who Elizabeth and Phillip are and who they want to be in the future, and whether or not they can continue to be deep cover KGB agents while leading their other life as suburbanites with family. I'm going to guess that the writers are going to stick with the major plot being about whether or not they lose their grip on their double life and whether or not they end up exposed by the CIA/FBI/US government or whether or not they end up exposing themselves by not being able to keep it altogether or defecting. In a sense, I'm hoping and thinking that the writers take a big page out of Breaking Bad's playbook and make the main plot point whether or not someone is going to find out about their double life just like the main plot point in Breaking Bad ended up being whether or not Walt's double life would be exposed. There was the ""will Walt die in the drug trade"" plot line and there was the ""Will Walt be exposed by Hank or someone else"" plot line and I can see how these two plots might inspire the writers. The plot lines could be ""will Phillip and Elizabeth die in the espionage world during a mission or intelligence-gathering gone wrong"" or ""will they be exposed by a more cerebral, cat and mouse game like the one that Hank and Walt played that ends in a disastrous manner.""

If this season ends with a major ""Holy shit!"" moment given all of the psychological/emotional peaks and drama that we've seen then this season will have to be the one that gets this series the critical reception that is going to start getting it the mainstream attention that it deserves for Season 3.

[Feminist protesters at University of Toronto pull a fire alarm to shut down a male issues talk.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWgslugtDow)

[Feminist protesters again shut down another talk about male issues and argue with Mens rights supporters at University of Toronto.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvYyGTmcP80)

The man that was protested at these two lectures was Dr. Warren Farrell who considers himself a feminist and was once a prominent member of the feminist movement from the 70s up until the 1990s when his views apparently began to diverge from Third wave feminist theory. I did some Googling on this guy and it's a pretty interesting backstory that he has. He apparently was living a pretty sweet life while operating as a well-regarded feminist according to [this article](http://www.salon.com/2001/02/06/farrell/) that I found. Here's an excerpt:

&gt;Warren Farrell, the feminist, had two houses, including a “gorgeous, gorgeous” home in the country. He drove a Maserati. Every article he wrote about women for the New York Times was published, without exception. When he made presentations at conferences, he was offered teaching positions in departments where he “was not even qualified to teach.” (His doctorate is in political science, not psychology, the subject of his five books.) He was the only man to be elected three times to the board of NOW in New York. He was invited to appear on Phil Donahue’s talk show no fewer than eight times.

&gt; Warren Farrell, the masculinist, has one house, which he does own, but it’s “nothing phenomenal.” He drives a 1989 Nissan 240SX. Nothing he has written about men for the New York Times has been published, without exception. The college professors have stopped calling and so have the feminists (although to this day the bio on his book jackets still begins with his NOW credentials). During his last appearance on “Donahue,” Farrell says, he started to address men’s issues. And that was, well, his last appearance on “Donahue.” Phil didn’t want him back, and Betty Friedan, if she didn’t actually want him dead, would probably have preferred to see him muzzled.

It's pretty interesting that he seemed to have had it made as a 20-30 year-old man and apparently gave up that nice lifestyle because he became so convinced that feminsm was no longer a movement that he could support as a man. 

/r/Shitredditsays and feminists really, really hate this guy and often claim that he advocated for date rape and that he is a misogynist. Well, I don't believe this at all and managed to locate an AMA that he held on reddit a year ago in which he addressed many of the concerns and accusations levied against him by SRS and feminists and I found his responses to be forthcoming and very eye-opening. [Here is his AMA if you're interested in how he defended himself from these very nasty accusations.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18tv7j/i_am_warren_farrell_author_of_why_men_are_the_way/)

This protest in Ottawa happened almost a year after the last protest at a Canadian university in April 2013.

[I actually made a comment about this a week or two ago and about male issues groups and gatherings being shut down by feminists and the comment got a ton of attention and was gilded 39x before SRS followers spammed the report button to get the thread from /r/todayilearned removed so that my comment couldn't be voted on and gilded any further. The basic issue that my comment responded to was why it is that Western justice systems are harsher on men than women and the negative affect that this has on men. I also talked about why it is that men need a men's movement of their own to address their social, economic, political, sexual, and cultural concerns. Here it is if you want to read it:](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/22dqqw/til_a_woman_in_2013_falsely_claimed_that_a_man/cglwp02?context=3) 

&gt; [A justice system] that's been lobbied to death by feminists for decades without anyone properly representing those being punished a.k.a men.

&gt;[Edit: But seriously though, when a college girl can straight up accuse a college male of rape without any evidence whatsoever apart from her word and the guy can be expelled from school in a kangaroo court system then you know that the gender issues pendulum has swung horribly too far to the other side.]
(http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/08/09/accused-rape-men-allege-discrimination-under-title-ix) 

&gt;Can anyone think of anything worse for a male to be called other than 'a rapist'? Remember the Duke lacrosse rape scandal? Yeah, turns out that the accuser was a drug-addled mentally ill woman who murdered her boyfriend a few years later and is now serving ~~life~~ 14 years in prison. It's too bad that feminists and the insane lefties in university academic departments were out for blood and wanted to lynch innocent men because they were privileged White male lax bros who were having too much fun partying and banging co-eds each weekend. They needed to be taken down a notch, right? /s

&gt;[Even after those privileged White boys were cleared of the rape charges, the lefty feminist professors from Duke's liberal arts and humanities divisions were so filled with hate and retarded social justice/privilege bullshit that they wouldn't even apologize to the boys whose lives they may well have ruined after these professors had called for their heads on a lacrosse stick.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_88)

&gt;Now, I usually don't wade into threads like this to give opinions and I usually stick to making jokes on reddit, but it's very easy to understand why men need some sort of movement to address their social, political, sexual, and economic concerns in this new century. Some men may not be fans of /r/MensRights but if you dislike the layout of the subreddit then you should try and look at the underlying theory that this apparent movement is centered around and founded upon. I have seen too many guys in my personal life have serious issues revolving around men's issues and the way that feminism entrenched within the legal/political system has hurt men and we all have read far too many stories of men not receiving justice or the legal/political system coddling and even protecting women at times when they do wrong both morally and/or legally. 

&gt;I personally think that the time is ripe for men to *at least* talk about these issues on places like the internet if they're afraid of coming out publicly and talking about male issues and the role that feminism should or shouldn't play in men's lives. [The very sad and troubling part about this first step is that feminists have waded so far into fascistic and thug-like territory that those men that actually seek to break down gender roles that tell them to keep their problems to themselves have to deal with unbelievable criminal behavior like this when they simply try to ***talk*** about male issues without feminists co-opting their movement and discussion from the word 'go'.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iARHCxAMAO0)

&gt;If you want to start with some light reading and to take in some basic and easy to digest information concerning what has gone wrong with feminism in this new century and the role that it is playing in the life of males then you might want to start with a more light-hearted subreddit like /r/Tumblrinaction and then maybe explore their sidebar to look for more information about gender issues, feminism, and male issues.

&gt;Like I've said before, /r/MensRights may not appeal to men and/or women and everyone is free to form their own opinions and thoughts on gender issues. Ideologies that work for one man or woman may not appeal or appear sensible to other men or women so it's nice that ideologies concerning gender issues fluctuate along a spectrum and are in no way rigid and fixed at this moment in time. [With that said, for those of you that are skeptical of the Men's Rights Movement as an alternative to feminism then here is an excellent comment sitting at 4000 points discussing the MRM, why it was formed, what its goals are, and why some men have come to feel that they need their own movement constructed from a non-feminist viewpoint that seeks to re-define themselves, their relationships with women, and their role/place in the legal, social, economic, sexual, and political realms in the Western world.](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jt1u5/cmv_i_think_that_mens_rights_issues_are_the/cbi2m7a?context=3)

&gt;I personally do not have a label for what I identify as when it comes to gender issues but this comment was what led me to look at the underlying theory and agendas behind modern day men's movements as potential alternatives to Third-wave feminism. 

&gt;Edit 2: I'm sorry but the reddit internet feminists that have already sent me a few PMs calling me ""RedPill scum"", ""neckbeard mens rights rapist"", and ""MRA mangina"" are perfectly illustrating my points for me and are only giving feminism a bad name and will only alienate men from feminism further.

OP posted further down in this thread that they posted this video before to /r/videos and it was removed. They provided some information about this protest in the removed thread that I'm just posting here since they haven't done so yet:

&gt; The first time and the second time this hapened was at the University of Toronto and the attack was carried out by the same type of people. /r/SRSsucks did some investigating and found out that /r/Shitredditsays and /r/againstmensrights members both attended these protests.

&gt;This protest in Ottawa took place almost exactly a year after the two protests in Toronto last April. These people are scum, obviously learned nothing about how to behave and that they're morons, and yet their ilk was allowed to be feminazis and not even let this woman talk.

SRS, /r/againstmensrights, and the protesters from these three different videos seem to have this idea that allowing male issues groups to talk is like Neville Chamberlain allowing Hitler to march into Czechoslovakia and this notion is just flat out retarded. The First Amendment is as American as it gets so anyone who is this staunchly opposed to it can git out.

cgxbxep,red321red321,"At the start of the Cold War, Henry Murray developed a personality profiling test to crack soviet spies with psychological warfare and select which US spies are ready to be sent out into the field. As part of Project MKUltra, he began experimenting on Harvard sophomores. He set one student as the control, after he proved to be a completely predictable conformist, and named him ""Lawful"".

Long story short, the latter half of the experiment involved having the student prepare an essay on his core beliefs as a person for a friendly debate. Instead, Murray had an aggressive interrogator come in and basically tear his beliefs to pieces, mocking everything he stood for, and systematically picking apart every line in the essay to see what it took to get him to react. But he didn't, it just broke him, made him into a mess of a person and left him having to pull his whole life back together again. He graduated, but then turned in his degree only a couple years later, and moved to the woods where he lived for decades.

In all that time, he kept writing his essay. And slowly, he became so sure of his beliefs, so convinced that they were right, that he thought that if the nation didn't read it, we would be irreparably lost as a society. So, he set out to make sure that everyone heard what he had to say, and sure enough, Lawful's ""Industrial Society and its Future"" has become one of the most well known essays written in the last century. In fact, you've probably read some of it. Although, you probably know it better as The Unabomber Manifesto.

He can no longer speak or move his body yet he is able to communicate and to compose music through his eye movements with the help of a computer system built just for him to compose music with. It's such a sad story because the guy was already well on his way to becoming a rock and metal God by 20 years of age yet we'll never know just how much amazing music he could have written and performed if he was healthy. The best way I could describe this tragic story is that it's akin to an alternate reality where LeBron James or Wayne Gretzky were drafted to play professionally and then both were stricken down by a disease that made it impossible for them to stand, run, or shoot a puck/ball and ended their careers before they really got started.

cgwoxws,red321red321,"Dear /r/soccer,

I can't believe how fast things change in the Premier League. I saw a foreign player in the league once when I was a kid, but now they're everywhere. The league went and got itself in a big multicultural hurry. My mates got me into this pub down the road called the Red Brewer, with a job pouring pints while watching United on the telly. It's hard work. I try to keep watching, but every loss and Moyes-ordered cross into the box  hurts my heart most of the time. I don't think I like the manager very much. Sometimes after work I go to the park and kick around with the lads. I keep thinking the City supporters won't taunt me and give me stick but they always do. I hope wherever the other sad United fans are, they're doing okay and hanging in there until next season.

I have trouble sleeping at night. I have bad dreams, like we're being relegated. I wake up scared. Sometimes it takes me a while to forget where we are in the league table. Maybe I should get me a ticket to the South of France and find a new oil rich club to support, so I can get away from home. I could shoot our manager while I was at it, sort of like a bonus. I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore. I don't like it here. I'm tired of being a mid-table club. I've decided not to stay. I doubt they'll kick up any fuss. Not for an old supporter like me.

Study accounting. 

Just make sure you know what you are getting into. It's much more stable of a position but half the pay of an O&amp;G job. People are always spilling so there is definitely long term potential to it.

I am an exceptionally uninformed opinion because I lack experience in, and the braincells for, this game, but I saw the post about making the houses need things to be delivered directly. Maybe I am wrong but I got the impression there was lots of feedback from people who have mastered the game quite thoroughly and were concerned with their more complicated creations. We should not rule out that I am a complete moron, but I played 2-3 hours into my first game and got to a point where I was happily making X in once place and Y in another, for distinct purposes, but then the time came where X needed to get to Y and I thought heck and nearly gave up lol. I think building a market and chuting a farm into it was my first little satisfying victory of automation which was rewarding. In my opinion, requiring relatively spaghetti chutes and planning from the start would have been too much too quickly for me. Honestly I still don't know how I'd do it nicely.

ga99c3z,andrewsmith1986,"Honestly, I do not know. I'll conjecture a  guess but it will be just that. 

It's probably a mineral grown from solution (same way natural crystals are formed) and I'd guess SiO2 (quartz, amethyist, tigers eye, flint, chert, and like 100 other things that you could have heard of) with some sort of heavy [as in a high percent, not some worth of high (+) iron, prob still Fe (+3)I think] concentration of Iron to super saturate it to get it red vs purple. 

If it was blue I'd say it was copper. 

Amethyst is sio2 with iron impurity so I'm not quick to complain about the title. 

You could do the same with sugar water, string, and food coloring. 


But, I could be way off but that's my guess. 


Prob same chem formula but different heat and pressure. Minerals are very specific about chemical composition. Diamonds have to be carbon. Can't have a non carbon diamond but you could have a diamond with impurities which would color it. Typically each elemental impurity has a specific color but some can vary depending on lots of variables. 

A stone with one make up is called a mineral. A stone with many minerals is a rock. There are lots of other rules that people have argued but the definition is:

* It must be a naturally occurring substance formed by natural geological processes, on Earth or other extraterrestrial bodies.

* It must be a solid substance in its natural occurrence. 

* It must have a well-defined crystallographic structure; or, more generally, an ordered atomic arrangement.

* It must have a fairly well defined chemical composition

All fairly simple to understand without a higher education. 

But consider Ice. Ice is a mineral by definition. Is a cut and pollished ice cube a gem stone in any form of the word? Is there anything distinguishing man made ice from natural? if you added chemicals to H2O that were indistinguishable for most people, is it still Ice?

g98l4dx,Apostolate,"&gt; they'll only adapt progressive ideas once there's no real need to be a torchbearer for them. They offer nothing (when it's actually needed) and want everything in return (the vote). They chose this path so why do they act surprised when it's despised some fringe elements?

Someone has to pass legislation that gets 20 million Americans health insurance even if they have preexisting conditions. Someone has to pass legislation that legalizes gay marriage, that legalizes weed. You're really really under valuing this. It's what actually changes peoples' lives.

&gt;It's always not the time.

Except, all the times it is the time and progress has been made on social issues in particular. Things were different then, but a Democrat signed the Bill of Rights, which led to the parties we see today. So much progress has been made, and you're just discounting all of it. So myopic my dude. Trump is literally trying to roll back Democratic progress on trans people in the military etc, and you're pretending there's been no progress at all.

&gt;One can see how that can be a hard pill to swallow for a more progressive minority and how that process can be frustrating. Voting really seems to not matter if Democrats will only advocate for something once the populace is already convinced of it. 

Yes it does, because you have a reactionary right win populist party trying to undo the will of the majority. So you at least have to depressingly vote to keep the status quo. Sad but true.


&gt;Doing grassroots activism seems more productive as that actually convinces people (and can push Democrats in that direction). Apparently, before you enable Democrat politicians you need to convince the whole country first or it's barely worth anything.

**Yes. 100%, make cultural change, and you will see the results in representation. You need to build the consensus on the issues to have those perspectives represented by politicians. This is how it works, this is what I'm trying to say.**

&gt;And then, when you then see Democrats moving further to the right and, for example, being wary of removing Bush and/or Trump tax cuts to the rich while approving huge military budgets then those parties can look awfully similar from a certain point of view :/

Biden is more left of 2012 Obama in my opinion and many others would make that argument. He's left of Hillary and legislatively. There isn't some permanent slide of the Democrats towards the right. But to be fair the republicans have MASSIVELY moved to the right over the last 40 years and that has to be considered as context.

&gt;In conclusion: The Democrats don't get to complain about the fatalism of US progressives about voting when it's the Democrats who cause it in the first place.

&gt;How would you feel if I were to slap you in the face and then berate you for feeling pain while at the same time describing myself as the good guy because I didn't stab you?

This is an absurd argument and not accurate. But if someone who slaps me in private is the only one saving me from the death penalty, I'm sure as fuck going to support them until I can escape that relationship. Aka, vote Dems in the general elections, and go for a new minor party in state and local elections, but coalition together vs reactionary right wing parties.",politics,1,1603041318,
g989ho4,Apostolate,"&gt; Has anybody looked into the reasons why they vote less? I mean having a two party system where neither party is really representing you could be a rather good indicator for why people feel like voting is ""useless"". Stuff like this:
&gt; 
&gt; https://theintercept.com/2020/04/09/nonvoters-are-not-privileged-they-are-largely-lower-income-non-white-and-dissatisfied-with-the-two-parties/
&gt; 
&gt; If your (not you but the politicians) answer to people not voting for you is to look elsewhere instead of trying to win votes then that's on you and not on those voters for not getting those votes. That's kinda my whole point.
&gt;
&gt; The link above (theintercept) mentions how most nonvoters are poor and feel like both parties are the same and don't represent them anymore. Any vote wouldn't materially change their condition so they don't spend a day (or more) on voting when they need to work anyways.
&gt; 
&gt; Wouldn't it be easier to address those undecided voters (and your own progressive agenda) than try to claw back a few Republicans with even harsher Republican-lite policy ideas? And with voter turnout being so low (like you just wrote) there should be a lot of people that could be convinced to vote for Democrats with such a move. They wouldn't even need to be on the left fringe, just people who would benefit from that type of policies.

Ok let's focus our discussion for a minute. Why aren't people voting? Let's look at what the article you linked actually says from the voters, and not what the article may or may not have concluded:

[why are non-voters, not voting](https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2020/04/combine_images-10.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;q=90)

The biggest predictor of non-voters is poor, young, minority, + LOW-EDUCATION. The biggest reasons for not voting, a laundry list of embarrassing bullshit reasons. I forgot/didn't register/don't care.

However, there's an important nugget here. There's a lot of time, money, and effort put into disengaging these voters with ""both parties suck, don't vote!"" propaganda, and voter disenfranchisement (removing poll locations, voter ID laws etc) that heavily target 1) minorities 2) young people. In many other countries voting is trivially, and registration is automatic. Not in America. It's designed to be hard, BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. The democrats are working every year to get more people voting, because more people agree with them. 55% of non-voters would vote for the democratic party if they voted at all. They don't have to shift left for that to be the case. 

Let's look at gay marriage in the US Democratic position vs popular opinion.

[gay marriage popular opinion](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FT_16.04.11_sameSex_support.png)

Gay marriage became majority approved significantly in ~2012. Hillary Clinton officially supported gay marriage in 2013:

[LGBT Americans ... are full and equal citizens, and they deserve the rights of citizenship. That includes marriage.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/)

Obama was initially in favor, then only in favor of civil unions and opposed on religious grounds because it was politically expedient:

[“Opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church, and as he ran for higher office, he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a ‘sacred union’,” Axelrod writes.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/10/obama-frustrated-same-sex-marriage-david-axelrod-book)

Then came out in favor later:

[Obama’s evolution has roughly tracked public opinion.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/10/obama-frustrated-same-sex-marriage-david-axelrod-book)

The Democratic party is cynical and pragmatic. And are willing to do corporatist and non-progressive shitty things as a political party. But they're following public opinion for the most part. The ACA/public option/Medicare for all thing is a whole nother can of worms I don't want to get into in this discussion. You can morally oppose the democrats for dragging their feet on moral issues until there's majority approval, but the reality is the Republicans are in a polar moral opposite and can't wait to take away rights. It's in that context that you have to analyze the democratic party, not in a European context.",politics,1,1603035034,
g97ykx9,Apostolate,This is actually my argument for why we need to automate cars to be as safe as trains etc. haha.,politics,1,1603028863,
g97ydht,Apostolate,No one believes you. Heh.,politics,1,1603028742,
g97vhzk,Apostolate,"&gt; No I can't I'm not from the USA. But I see the same (for local politics adjusted here in Germany) centre left doing similar stuff and then wondering why they aren't winning.

Ok let me give you my background, lived in US most of my life, but lived in Switzerland, Swiss mother, and moved to the UK recently. If you have not experience the American way of life/culture you will not understand how little collectivity is baked into the system, and how much corporatization of everything that is accepted. You can't project how the center left in Germany behaves on to the Democrats in the US. The context is EXTREMELY different.

&gt; And like above (and your bit about stats): Why do the Democrats even need those fringe votes so badly if there's nothing useful for them and all the good stuff's somewhere in the middle? How does it work that a handful of disillusioned leftists can wreck their plan but they don't pick up enough votes in this fertile middle?

In 2016 in the US we had a ~56% voter turn out of *registered* voters. Germany had 76.2% turn out.  Your country has recently been the lowest turn out its had in a century, while the US has averaged close to this kind of turn out since the 1920s. Keep that in mind. Then keep in mind progressives, minorities, and liberals etc have even LOWER turn out than average, and even lower turn out in non-presidential election years. Aka midterm elections.

This puts us in a position where our politicians survive on old white moderate and conservative voters. If progressive/young people regularly voted, things would be very different. But they aren't. Example, in Florida people over 65 are like 30% of the voting age population, but 50% of the turned out vote. 

[Take a look at this picture](https://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/8lobi9xmc0i2_lg2jui6sa.png). Now add to that picture that the liberal demographic is much younger, more minority, and both those groups unreliably vote. As young people never vote. 

&gt; This video is essentially your (and the Demcrats') point:
&gt; 
&gt; https://twitter.com/zei_squirrel/status/1299525466211127298
&gt; Why is it not working like this? Why do the Democrats always end up blaming the left wing for their own campaign losses when it's the Democrats who chose this path—that assumes that this left is useless to them and can be discarded—with confidence. Those white Republican voters are not the ones Republican voter suppression tactics are targeting.

I would argue sadly, it is working, the Democrats look like they're on the precipice of a presidential election victory of the largest popular vote margin in a very long time. Now, Biden is moderate, and has made some seriously progressive additions to his campaign promises, but he seems to also be courting moderate republicans which sends some people into a tailspin, but look how it's resulting in superior polling.

&gt; If the Democrats are going where all these votes are, and if stats show this to be true, then why are they not winning all the time? This has been going on since the 90s. It worked once—the first time—and the assumption is that it should keep working but somehow the USA got Bush and Trump, even if it was a close call.

**They've won the popular vote** in every election up to and including 1992, except 2004 post 9/11 Bush Re-election. You may not understand how backward out system is, and how entrenched and empowered the conservatives are by the system. Trump and Bush won while losing the popular vote. Trump *could* win again while losing the popular vote by *even more than last time*. The places that are the deciding voters in the electoral college are more conservative than the average American. A sad reality of our system.

&gt; How come an upstart like Obama was able to pick enough non-voters with a simple message of ""hope and change"" (instead of shifting to the right) that it led to him winning against the establishment Democrat candidate, becoming the Democrat's nominee, and finally the president.

Gigantic financial disaster brought on by unregulated markets. That's pretty much it man. The biggest predictor of a presidential campaign is how the economy is going under the incumbent president. Americans have been conditioned on short term well being and instant gratification.

&gt; Could it be that trying to get non-voters (and not trying to pry ""undecided"" voters from the Republicans) is a viable option too? Of course one would have to constantly work on pushing progressive policies (show them you are actually fighting for them and not the big Democrat donors) like how Republicans are pushing conservative policies to keep their vote and not become a run-of-the-mill centrist Democrat politician and lose all those gains just in time for the other Clinton to lose to Trump.

Democrats try to get out non-voters in battle ground areas. The things that appeal to the non-voters in North Carolina/Arizona/Florida are just not the same material that appeals to a left win person in California or Germany. Prove me wrong and I'll do some thinking.",politics,1,1603027167,

g95kuie,Apostolate,"&gt; How? They already did that in the 90s. That's what got Clinton his win. There's not much more voters to capture in the middle. Or do you really think they'll get those hardcore republicans just by shifting a bit more to the right (time and time again).

So the Clinton move heralded in an era of the Democrats winning every popular vote (except 2004) since 1992, including 1992, after an era of losing 5/6 elections over 24 years? Carter won a single term and was promptly defeated. Does that put more into perspective how effective their shift was? Unfortunately the shift involved pandering to corporations, and we're working to undo the damage now. And will be for some time.

&gt; Why don't they even try doing that on the left? They are supposed to be the progressive party, after all. And shouldn't a party by default try to appeal to voters instead of expecting votes to just land in their lap.

The electoral college is more conservative than the average American voter, and teh average American voter is more conservative in voting habits that the policy ideas they'd agree with in isolation. We need to effectively communicate the efficacy of progressive policies to the population before they'll accept more progressive representation and pursuit of those programs/policies. Example, people like ACA, they don't like Obamacare.

&gt; Where's the politicians' pragmatism? Why are only voters expected to compromise? This whole setup reeks or the ""corporate loyalty"" game where the company expects the employee to be loyal to the company but won't ever do the same in return.

I don't know what to tell you. In the best of times, politics is literally all compromise. 40% of this country never recovered from the civil war/reconstruction culturally and we're still fighting that war today. How are we supposed to have the population represented in an uncompromised way?
 
&gt; And if there are no reliable voters on the left (like you proclaim) then why complain that this left is not voting when you didn't even count on them in the first place and went looking for voters further to the right?

I don't rely on them, I'm not a politician. I would want people who think like me to get pragmatically involved and push the needle/overton window/political landscape to the left in an effective lasting manner. And first and foremost to vote for the best choices possible locally and nationally.

&gt; What is it now? Can that left win you elections or not? Or is it just a convenient scapegoat when the Democrats don't win.

I can't tell you why or why not the democrats win or lose elections other than 1) the republicans regularly cheat in 101 ways, and then accuse the democrats of cheating 2) and the democratic base is not reliable. Hillary literally got less votes than Obama, against a disastrous horrifying Trump candidacy, 4 years later when the number of people eligible to vote had gone up. What's worse is that Obama got over 3 million votes less in 20012 than 2008. 3 elections in a row the number of people voting for Democratic pres. went down. They get all excited in a spike/rush, and then it fades when change doesn't happen quickly. If that doesn't show that Democratic/more progressive voters aren't unreliable I don't know what does. The right wing loonies show up every year, and it means their candidates are getting pushed further and further to the right. We should be doing the same.

fmk21bc,dickfromaccounting,"“The Greenland shark's eye lens is composed of a specialised material - and it contains proteins that are metabolically inert,"" explained Mr Neilson.

""Which means after the proteins have been synthesised in the body, they are not renewed any more. So we can isolate the tissue that formed when the shark was a pup, and do radiocarbon dating.""

The team looked at 28 sharks, most of which had died after being caught in fishing nets as by-catch.

Using this technique, they established that the largest shark - a 5m-long female - was extremely ancient.

Because radiocarbon dating does not produce exact dates, they believe that she could have been as ""young"" as 272 or as old as 512. But she was most likely somewhere in the middle, so about 400 years old.” Read [more](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37047168)",interestingasfuck,1,1586142662,

The comments on my last couple of posts in r/announcements felt less and less like a Reddit comment thread. I believe this is because there is no actual community there and therefore no real conversation. Does this resonate with you at all?

Comments on front-page political ads would likely be even worse.

The idea behind this approach is to enable what Reddit does best, provide commentary (critical or not) and, in the case of my posts, facilitate discussions like this one.

Long term, we’ll use crossposts / Other Discussions / and make a proper UI for this. Whether we continue with this approach for r/announcements, political ads, all ads, or other posts is yet to be decided. 

Yes, we talked with mods of political subs before today and received some helpful context and feedback.

They’re not perfect (we know we need to reach more mods and bring more things to these councils earlier), but they’ve already increased understanding of mod needs within the company and helped inform several product efforts, including some upcoming user blocking tools.

Some things we’re planning aiming to do this year:

* Publicly sharing summaries of these calls
* Expanding the number of councils we have
* More regularly cycling members through so we can bring more moderators
* [Creating a council on social justice issues and hosting an all-council call on evolving our policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/gw5dj5/remember_the_human_an_update_on_our_commitments/)",announcements,47,1591386754,
ft08mel,spez,"I’m the first to say our governance systems are imperfect. But I also think the concept that these mods “control” numerous large subreddits is inaccurate. These are mod teams, not monarchies, and often experienced mods are added as advisors. Most of the folks with several-digit lists of subreddits they mod are specialists, and do very little day-to-day modding in those subreddits; how could they?

In terms of abuse… We field hundreds of reports about alleged moderator abuse every month as a part of our enforcement of the [Moderator Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/help/healthycommunities/). The broad majority—more than 99%—are from people who undeniably broke rules, got banned, and held a grudge. A very small number are one-off incidents where mods made a bad choice. And a very, very small sliver are legitimate issues, in which case we reach out and work to resolve these issues—and escalate to actioning the mod team if those efforts fail.

I have lots of ideas (trust me, my team’s ears hurt) about how to improve our governance tools. There are ways we can make it easier for users to weigh in on decisions, there’s more structure we can add to mod lists (advisory positions, perhaps), and we will keep on it.",announcements,-1120,1591386479,

This ensures that the sanctions from our mods and admins have impact, and that we minimize the ability of users to continue to abuse others.

I admit we spent too much time with moderation teams that claimed to be doing their best while large numbers of users upvoted content that clearly broke our policies, which made it clear the issues were not of moderation, but of the community culture. Once we realized the quarantine was not working, we increased our pressure on the mod team to bring the community in line with our policies, open to both them either succeeding in this or failing and being banned. Instead, a number of the community members decided to go off-platform and create their own website, leaving r/the_donald in its current, near-dead state.

fs1kukf,spez,"I empathize with your post. I'm 36, and I went through a phase about a year ago where I wanted to get more disciplined about working out because I wanted to see more consistent progress. I got on a consistent routine, started tracking more, ate better, and generally became more intentional with exercise. I started making progress and was really enjoying myself. However, it seemed like every time I was really getting into the groove, I'd pull, strain, or otherwise hurt something and then be out of commission for a while for a couple of weeks.

There are two things that have really helped, and I can say happily that I've been relatively injury free for a while and the setbacks I have had are for days not weeks.

The first is physical. I've really embraced warming up. I used to think that a long warmup would exhaust me and prevent me from performing well for the meat of the workout. Instead, now I think about how I can't perform my best unless unless my heart is moving, my blood is flowing, and everything is fully activated. For any particular exercise—especially if I'm going to try and push it that day—I do a bunch (4+) warmup sets to really get things going, and instead of telling myself that I'm a little tired, I tell myself that I'm warmed up and ready to go.

The second is mental. I used to tell myself that I'm getting older and injuries are just part of things now, and even worse, that when I hurt myself that it'll take a long time to heal because I'm older. I can guarantee if that if that's what you tell yourself, that will be your experience. On the other hand, I've found that if I don't accept that reality that I can both avoid injury generally and bounce back quickly when I do hurt something. If I tweak something, I go back to that muscle the very next day—usually with a lighter weight and being super intentional about good form—and prove to myself that the injury isn't going to be a factor. I've bounced back a couple times in days from what used to take me weeks in the past.

Please include a reasonable disclaimer about me not being a professional. Just thought I'd share what's worked for me.",fitness30plus,1,1590630234,

Since August, 2005, Reddit has been bigger than I ever thought it would be. I feel incredibly thankful to have been a part of it.

\&gt; How has your opinions of the internet changed from when Reddit was created all those years ago compared to now?

I feel that it's less that my opinions that have changed—though my ability to articulate them has definitely improved—but more so it's the world that's change around us. In the early days, Reddit didn't feel that special, but as the internet evolved and social media exploded, I began to wonder if our idealism about privacy and community put us in the minority, and today, I'm pleased to see these ideas which have always been important to us have become more important in the mainstream.

\&gt; Are there any Reddit posts from those years that you specifically remember and that stand out to you?

The challenge with r/popular is that as Reddit becomes more diverse—a good thing—the quality of r/popular declines. I call this ""Regression to the Meme"".

Our policies forbid any sexual or suggestive content involving minors or someone who appears to be a minor, and we deploy a number of automated technical tools to keep this type of content off the site.

For example, we employ PhotoDNA against all image files uploaded to Reddit, drawing on the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) hash database. We also have our own internally developed hashing tool to apply to images and prevent their re-upload.

For videos, we employ the YouTube CSAI Match tool to detect known CSAM in that format. Further, we proactively block the posting of links to offsite domains that are known to host CSAM.

your long term prospects are great, but that doesn't help in the short

people at the start of their careers. Because of the health care bill,
you can stay on your parent's plan until you're twenty six. Because of
our student loan bill, we are lowering the debt burdens that young
people have to carry. But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that's why the choice in this election is so important. The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we've put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow.

g8y1o01,GovSchwarzenegger,"Terminating gerrymandering is my passion! And just to be clear, it became my passion when I was still Governor because the legislators from both sides kept telling me policies were good ideas, but they couldn’t go there with their districts. So I fell into it, because I started to study why they couldn’t go vote for things they thought were good ideas, and I became more committed when the first time the Democratic and Republican leaders agreed with each other was in telling me to let gerrymandering go. After a few tries, we finally passed Proposition 11 and created an independent commission. Every state should have one and I will keep fighting for it. If you are in Virginia, make sure to vote for redistricting reform, and if you are in Missouri, make sure to vote against the legislature’s attempt to undo the reform the voters just passed in 2018. Some of the Democrats tried the same thing after we passed Proposition 11, and put a repeal on the ballot in 2010. The voters were smart enough to reject it.

I also fell into these polling places grants. I never thought these things would be my passion, but when I learned about them, it happened. The lesson is never stop learning and you’ll always find something to keep you busy.",politics,1,1602801211,✔ Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R-CA)
g8y0ell,GovSchwarzenegger,"We sent letters to every county formerly covered by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act offering the grants, and my team called many of their offices to remind them. The officials who applied and accepted funding are heroes. But we will be doing a full study at my institute of who did and didn’t apply, so hopefully the ones who didn’t apply for my money realize they won’t be able to use budget problems as an excuse again.",politics,1,1602800512,✔ Gov.

This is why I planned the summit. And I told everyone coming, I don’t just want to hear talk. I want to hear concrete solutions that we can put forward so we have a blueprint for a more equal country. It will be on Twitch tomorrow through Sunday.

Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Reverend Al Sharpton",u_GovSchwarzenegger,28,1602795366,
g8xqe5e,GovSchwarzenegger,"I owe this country literally everything. This is the least I can do. The more I learned about how many polling stations were closed for “budget reasons”, the more I knew I had to do something, because I made all of my money because I moved here. I have been inspired by the local elections officials who have applied. Nancy, who applied for the grant in Muscogee County, is a real rockstar. Not only did she open a supercenter, but she figured out a way to give business to their convention center and to hire food service workers who have been furloughed since March as the poll workers. That’s American problem solving at its best. You can see the counties where we have approved grants here: www.pollingaccessgrants.org.",politics,1,1602795151,✔ Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R-CA)
g8xcgux,GovSchwarzenegger,"Thank you for sharing! Giving out these grants has truly been a joy. I’ll keep doing it, and so far we haven’t declined a single county. 

All of you, please vote. If you can, volunteer as a poll worker and be a democracy superhero.",politics,1,1602788080,✔ Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R-CA)
g8t278r,GovSchwarzenegger,"Lulu is the donkey and I got her for Christmas last year, so she’s young, Whiskey is the mini-horse and I’ve had her for 20 years, and Cherry is the mini-dog who we adopted. I call Cherry noodle because when I sit on zoom calls she lays all over my legs like a little noodle.",aww,6,1602691230,
g8sytv5,GovSchwarzenegger,"I apologize to you all, but I am going to keep sharing these stories because I get really pumped up when I see the impact of my grants. The joy I get out of this is so much more than the joy I get when I see a few good movie reviews.

I also want to remind all of you to vote, and if you can, to volunteer as a poll worker. Some of my grants are going toward hazard pay because there aren’t enough poll workers, so if you’re young and want to help, please consider it. I’ll keep sending out my money, all you guys have to do is vote and consider volunteering this year!",u_GovSchwarzenegger,1,1602689554,
g8qvb9d,GovSchwarzenegger,"I made this commitment myself so I’m funding my grants and not asking for help, because this is personal to me. But you should start your own campaign! This grant was over 200k and the last one I posted was 250k, so it might be hard to raise that money in time to open polling centers, and you also have to be sure the counties will accept the money. Pizzas for people waiting in line sounds like a great campaign where you could be successful! I’m rooting for you and I expect updates.",u_GovSchwarzenegger,23,1602632931,
g8qhh7k,GovSchwarzenegger,"Giving these grants and talking to the people on the ground has been my favorite part of the last two weeks. I enjoy my zoom meetings with studio executives, but I LOVE these calls. The elections administrator told us they might hit 70–80% turnout!",u_GovSchwarzenegger,4,1602625213,
g8qfwwo,GovSchwarzenegger,You absolutely nailed it. I really hope you didn’t put the lights in your mouth like I did. The battery acid was disgusting.,blunderyears,3,1602624394,
g7y3pmz,GovSchwarzenegger,"Thank you! Every state should be following our lead and unrigging the system. More and more states are joining us every year. But until we take the power to pick their voters away from politicians in every state, we won’t have the accountability we need to create performance in DC.",assholedesign,1,1602024853,
g779b9f,GovSchwarzenegger,"I thought you guys might like to see this, because I’m personally obsessed with follow-through. You can have great ideas, but without follow-through, they’ll never happen. I am so excited Cameron accepted our offer and can open these 2 supercenters to serve between 20,000 and 24,000 extra voters.",u_GovSchwarzenegger,62,1601490896,
g6l8r9k,GovSchwarzenegger,Thank you for your service! Some of my favorite moments as Governor were schmoozing over a meal in Baghdad with our National Guard troops and welcoming you guys home at the airport when I could. I will keep it up because people like you inspire me.,The_Mueller,1,1601079669,
g6dln6e,GovSchwarzenegger,"I’d also appreciate it if all of you took this as a call to action. I’m not asking you to donate to this. I’m not even accepting donations. But when you complain on social media about inequality, or schools, or government, ask yourself, “What am I doing?” How are you helping to solve the problem you complain about? I have seen thousands of tweets about voting access, and in early applications, one of the biggest problems is a lack of poll workers. Are you young? Then don’t complain. Work the polls. If you complain about inequality, how many times have you volunteered for an inner-city after-school program or just to tutor someone? Vision, then dialogue, then action. Keep that dialogue section short, focus on the vision and action.",u_GovSchwarzenegger,94,1600911971,
g6djipl,GovSchwarzenegger,"This was not a rant toward you, by the way, and Whiskey and Lulu say they want some cookies.",WhitePeopleTwitter,24,1600910788,
g6djfrb,GovSchwarzenegger,"Thank you for tagging. I really do owe everything to this country, and I have a lot more to give than most people. 

One thing I hope people will take away is that they can’t just complain. They can do something about whatever they are upset about. Most people don’t have enough money to pay local government’s bills, and I understand that. But you don’t have to make a fortune to be a poll worker for a day - which, by the way, I am finding out in the early applications is a major problem (and you do make money). One of the great things about free countries is you can complain, but if you are going to complain, I just ask that you put your action or your money where your mouth is. DO SOMETHING. We’ve had enough talk. I am sick and tired of hearing people tell me how unequal or screwed up our country is, and then when I ask what they have done, it’s “uhhhhhh.” Volunteer at an inner city school, tutor kids, be a poll worker, be a special olympics coach. DO SOMETHING. Someone, somewhere, needs you. Like my dad said, be useful.",WhitePeopleTwitter,129,1600910742,
g6d6drv,GovSchwarzenegger,"I’m omitting my website because my team says posting in public will cause a lot of troll applications, but if you live in a state that was a former section 5 jurisdiction under the voting rights act, your elections officials received this today. If they have closed polling stations for budget reasons, ask them to apply.",u_GovSchwarzenegger,156,1600901134,
g5pdcms,GovSchwarzenegger,It’s still up,u_GovSchwarzenegger,7,1600439080,
g4qrm9y,GovSchwarzenegger,"First of all, thank you. Second of all, I still don’t think my first million was self-made, although you are right that I made it before I became a movie star. I saved up enough money to buy my first small apartment building (I bought a six unit building instead of buying a house so that I could live in the owner’s unit and rent the rest) from my bricklaying business (which I couldn’t have done without my best friend Franco) and some bodybuilding money (bodybuilding was not a big moneymaker then, I got $1,000 for winning Mr. Olympia, but I wouldn’t have been in America or bodybuilding without Joe Weider). And a realtor who was also an immigrant named Olga mentored me as I looked for my first investment building. Really, thank you for the kind comment, I don’t want this to end up on one of those reddits where I pop up when I correct someone, I just think all of us need to acknowledge that we didn’t succeed alone. When we tell stories about our success, I think it’s important to include all of the characters, not just ourselves. We all need help, even when we work our asses off.",nextfuckinglevel,121,1599769759,
g3rpscf,GovSchwarzenegger,"Let me chime in with my opinion on this since reddit is more cynical than me.

Some things, you can just enjoy. If you’re dealing with global politics or a life or death situation, get a second or third opinion and be skeptical. If someone posts a photo I sent them and people are enjoying it, absolutely do not call them a liar unless you have proof. In this case it doesn’t add anything. And worse, it’s lazy. In this case, a quick look at my posts would have found the comment where I said I would sign a photo on my machine would have saved the guy. Not believing anything you read is just as lazy and dumb as believing anything you read.",quityourbullshit,107,1599080539,
g3qf23s,GovSchwarzenegger,"Shhh. Don’t give it away or I will never get through my inbox. But seriously, this was a fantastic birthday gift and I am glad Radon Labs is getting the attention he deserves.",pics,1,1599062895,
g3qegtf,GovSchwarzenegger,"I didn’t mean to go hard on him, I meant to point out he was wrong and give a little bit of advice. I’m also not sure I went too hard on him, but I would be curious on why you thought so. In my mind, if you wrongly call someone a fake or a liar without evidence, you should feel pretty good if you’re politely corrected.",woodworking,8,1599062623,
g3q5fu3,GovSchwarzenegger,"The guy isn’t necessarily an asshole! The internet pile-ons also drive me crazy. I just wanted to make sure he understood it’s fine to just enjoy things.

And to make the point a little more clearly for anyone else who does this online, saying something is fake without proof does not make you better than someone who accepts something as real without proof. You’re just a negative mirror image of them. 

Here is my social media rule: always ask if you are adding to the conversation, or subtracting. Am I adding joy, knowledge, laughter, anything? Post! Or am I subtracting joy or knowledge? Don’t post. It’s simple.",woodworking,13,1599059036,

g3ptrej,GovSchwarzenegger,"I signed in on my machine, using my hand and a stylus, like I said I would on the first reddit post, so I think it counts as hand-signed. Everything is not a conspiracy, sometimes you can just enjoy things.",woodworking,1,1599054001,

g3j7s03,GovSchwarzenegger,"I have chess tables all over! My best friend and I used to play before or after we lifted. I still play with some of my training partners. But I wouldn’t move it even if I stopped playing in the gym, because that table brings back so many memories of Franco.",u_GovSchwarzenegger,45,1598919071,
g3j7l88,GovSchwarzenegger,"My gym has every machine and dumbbell I need and a barbell and plates! Also, it has a chess table. I am confused, but maybe people assume I have a full spa with scented towels. I trained in gyms that looked like dungeons when I was Mr. Olympia. You and your training partners matter more than your surroundings in the gym.",nfl,57,1598919014,
g3j02sg,GovSchwarzenegger,"I wouldn’t look for new exercises until you’ve tried the plan you’ve been procrastinating about. If the whole plan is too much for you, just try doing 25 squats and pushups when you wake up. Do that for a week, then add in the rest of my bodyweight plan once you’ve proven to yourself you can do it. But don’t look for new stuff when you haven’t done what’s in front of you. I think half of the problem with fitness these days is people start a plan and then see something shinier and newer and leave their plan behind. Stick with it. Don’t add new things until you master old things.",bodybuilding,40,1598915103,"7x Mr. Olympia, Terminator, Former Governor of CA, The GOAT"

g3ikebq,GovSchwarzenegger,"I thought you guys would enjoy this. My shoulder surgeries have killed my pressing, but my back has stayed strong.

T-bars are one of my absolute favorite exercises.",bodybuilding,656,1598907530,"7x Mr. Olympia, Terminator, Former Governor of CA, The GOAT"
g3ijx06,GovSchwarzenegger,"Bent-over rows and t-bar rows have always been some of my favorite exercises. My shoulder injuries have limited my pressing weight, but every so often I like to lift heavy when I’m pulling to push myself.",u_GovSchwarzenegger,431,1598907291,

g2cm1fu,GovSchwarzenegger,"I’m glad it inspired you! I would rest 2-3 minutes between sets for building strength. For strength, you want to hit all of the reps perfectly. 

If you’re trying to lose weight, cut the rest as much as you can - maybe 1 minute. When I was doing really heavy lifts, benching 500 or deadlifting 700, my rests were much longer. Now, my focus is more on keeping body fat down, so I rest as little as I can. By moving from exercise to exercise with almost no rest, I get pretty schvitzy.

You sound like you’re going for both, so maybe alternate one day with longer rests and the next workout use short rests to get your heart rate up.",u_GovSchwarzenegger,1,1598033281,
g0ucsgk,GovSchwarzenegger,"There are roadblocks. Crappy schools are one. When I became governor I settled a lawsuit with the Williams family over unequal education. The democrats fought it, I settled with the ACLU as soon as I could. Our inner city schools had windows broken, less textbooks than our other schools, and weren’t the same. As part of the settlement they still have to do reports on how bad it is, so just thinking we have equality doesn’t work. That is only education, not housing where black people get higher mortgage rates even if they have the same credit score or policing. I want you to know equality is something you have to work at.",u_GovSchwarzenegger,3,1596932778,

g9hbeqp,mistborn,"Annotation Time:  Seems like a good place to talk about my philosophy on how I choose viewpoint characters for these books.  I've been getting DMs saying, ""Why no Dalinar viewpoints?"" or ""Why no Adolin viewpoints?""  And I can understand frustration there.  

When I started this series, however, I dug into the multi-book epic fantasy stories I'd enjoyed in the past, as well as the more popular examples, and tried to really nail down the pitfalls of the format.  A main one felt, to me, to be character sprawl.  These series tend to end up with so many interesting characters that the author, in turn, ends up having entire sequences (and even books) that don't move the storyline forward, but instead investigate new storylines.  

While I do appreciate some of that, I wanted to do what I could to mitigate that.  Which meant limiting my viewpoints, even among main characters.  This helps prevent sprawl, at least for me, because when I'm in someone's head, I naturally begin working on subplots and character arcs for them.  In this case, I needed to keep my focus, and limit myself.  To not try to do full sequences for every character in every part of every book.  While I know some of you would have enjoyed that, I would really rather finish this series before I am a hundred--and feel that the books need to be as focused as is reasonable for their length.

That's why when I outline, I look at all the characters that COULD have a viewpoint in a given section--then narrow my scope to a few of them.  Dalinar most certainly could have had viewpoints in Part One of this book, but I decided it was Navani's perspective that made the most sense for this story.  So, while you get to see a healthy dose of Dalinar, we don't have his viewpoints. 

Those will come later in the book, in a part where it makes sense to have his perspective on things.  I need to look for the characters that are adding the most to a given sequence--that usually means the ones who are changing the most, learning the most, or who have the most tension in their sequence.  I do feel bad for this somewhat cutthroat use of viewpoints at times, but I believe it is the right decision--it's either this, or watch the series balloon to many more books while at the same time slowing the narrative down to the point that books pass, and you wonder what was actually accomplished in them.  

Only three more chapters left in these previews before you get the entire book!  (Also, apologies for those who found this annotation repetitive from things I've said before.  It is difficult to judge, sometimes, what is new information to the majority of readers and what is becoming well-worn, so to speak.)",Stormlight_Archive,50,1603231253,:dragonsteel: Author

From the conversation with Rlain, and me finally being able to talk about some of the mechanics that let the Listeners survive on the Shattered Plains, to--of course--being able to write a fight using Awakening for the first time in a while.  I also enjoy writing about Kaladin through the eye of someone like Zahel, as it gives me some interesting opportunities.  

Obviously, I'm pushing (again) the boundaries of what a reader can be expected to remember/know about the cosmere to enjoy these books.  

It's my opinion that thinking ""Zahel can do weird, mysterious stuff I don't understand"" is all right for those readers who don't have a larger cosmere experience.  In fact, I'm confident that even if Warbreaker hadn't been released, I'd be writing scenes like this in the same way.  It's a common trope in fantasy for the powerful figure, like Gandalf, to do things that seem outside the rules everyone else has to follow.  One thing I like about having the cosmere to play with as a creator is that it lets me do scenes like this, which both are mysterious but also fully explained by the greater magic system, if you want to dig into it. 

I will say that Zahel is making an informed guess about Szeth in this chapter.  He doesn't know 100%.

Other interesting internet-era developments in storytelling are things like the SCP Foundation and the similar project surrounding the 1632 series (where fans, with the author's blessing, became involved in the series and began writing short fiction tie-ins that are to this day still being canonized in a fanzine edited by the original author.)

I think about how shadowy in my mind events of some ten years ago are, and I wonder what would happen if we lived centuries, instead of decades, in lifespan.  How would we adapt?  How would our physical apparatus (like our brains) adapt to something like that?  Like a car built to drive 200,000 miles instead being kept going for many times that.  

As an aside, one of the more fun stories I've read dealing with this idea is the [excellent 17776,](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football) which you really have to experience, since it defies explanation.  

I enjoyed writing this chapter, and many in this book, as the series is finally in a place where I can start delving into the personalities and attitudes of the fused.

The people who enslaved other people made conscious decisions to enslave them. Everyday they woke up and decided they were going to keep oppressing people. It wasn’t luck. It was racist and terrible and disgusting people being terrible disgusting and racist. 

You excuse their dastardly behavior when you call it “luck”.",BlackPeopleTwitter,1,1589305314,

fl29yyf,janellemonae,"He’s right.  But it was also a useless question.  He doesn’t need softball questions.  He is not an authority on anything.  He needs to get yes or no questions about whether or not he will approve specific funding for specific entities and it needs to be framed in a way that he would see himself as a hero if he says “yes” and be embarrassed if he says “no” or doesn’t know the answer.  His worst fear is being embarrassed as an idiot.  Questions about race and social cues are not anything that he could ever excel on because he has no emotional intelligence.   Besides, back to my original point, softball questions are not helpful to the American populace.  You have a few seconds to have an impact and ask questions on behalf of the American people in the middle of a crisis.  Don’t waste it trying to kiss ass.  People are dying.",politics,1,1584746252,

Re: Don’t Judge Me, that was the last song I put on the album. It was originally held by a song called French Kiss Masquerade which was a gorgeous &amp; funky song about ... an interesting but complicated relationship dynamic.  Anyway, it didn’t work out cause I wanted something that felt more intimate and FKM felt more like a sexy-mid. 

In the end, we were finishing scoring the beach scene in the emotion picture and French kiss just didn’t feel as emotional as the strings on don’t judge me. 

Plus DJM just really spoke so directly to so many of the themes I was trying to speak to on the album. ",popheads,80,1525312277,

You are making up facts. 

It’s called the rebel flag for a reason. 

It was made to rebel against the United States. 

The southern states tried to secede. 

That means they wanted to leave the United States. 

They wanted to have a nation where slavery was law. 

It has always been racist and treasonous. It was created to tear the country apart. And it still does. Do not be willfully ignorant. It was a war to preserve slavery. Slavery is racist. If you think otherwise, you’re ignoring all of the basic facts.

Ignorance of the truth is not an excuse to ignore the truth once it’s presented. ",changemyview,22,1513102040,
